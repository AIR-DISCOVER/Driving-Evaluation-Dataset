**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned that the cleaning wasn't thorough, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I noticed that too. Up ahead, there's a line on the ground indicating a pedestrian area, usually near schools. Did you brake? If there were people, I would definitely brake.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were concerned about the delivery truck, right? 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was planning to wait for it to pass because it was blocking the way. This area is near a school and a kindergarten, but there are no warning signs, just road markings.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you decide where to go when crossing the street? 

**Speaker 2:**
At that moment, it seemed like the vehicle was veering right, but it wasn't clear. I couldn't overtake it because it was in my lane. I had to wait, and I was worried it might suddenly swerve.

**Speaker 1:**
You saw the person ahead, but they were too far to be a concern, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they were too far to be an issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Aren't you afraid a car might suddenly come out from the side?

**Speaker 2:**
I am cautious, but if a car suddenly appears, it should yield to me. I usually drive in the left lane, so I feel I have a clear path.

**Speaker 2:**
I also leave half a lane on the right to ensure I'm visible and not suddenly cutting in. It's annoying when others don't do the same. 

**Speaker 1:**
You saw a group of people crossing the street and braked, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I slowed down a bit. I remember that person clearly.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like there was more than one person.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I noticed that too. 

**Speaker 1:**
You must have braked hard when you saw them suddenly move.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. I almost came to a complete stop to let them pass. With bicycles, you never know what they'll do next, so I drive slowly on small roads.
Speaker 1:
"Excuse me, yes, with these bicycles, you never know what they might do next. That's why I usually don't drive too fast on these small roads. This is probably the most complex road in the entire area. Yes, you have to check if there are any vehicles coming from this side. Today, there aren't any cars, but during rush hour, this place is usually busy with people coming and going after lunch."

Speaker 2:
"Yes, during lunchtime, the roads are crowded with people walking around. I always give way to electric bikes because they move very quickly. This stretch of road is usually clear until the right turn."

Speaker 1:
"While driving, I try to be cautious. Honestly, I know that sudden braking can be uncomfortable, so I try to avoid it. But sometimes, the brakes on unfamiliar cars are hard to gauge. You press them lightly, and nothing happens, but then a bit more pressure and they suddenly become very hard, which is quite uncomfortable. I think you were trying to let someone pass, but the car didn't respond as expected."

Speaker 2:
"Yes, exactly. The car didn't perform as I wanted, and with people suddenly appearing on the road, it became quite chaotic. There are non-motorized vehicles, pedestrian paths, and you have to make turns. An electric bike even gave way to me, which was helpful."

Speaker 1:
"Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to move forward, right? You have to keep an eye on everything around you. It's quite challenging."

Speaker 2:
"Yes, this main road and the intersection are quite large, so I have to be careful. For example, that big truck didn't slow down at all, so I had to wait for it to pass. It was very close to me, so I let it go first. I could see it was going to turn right."

Speaker 1:
"How did you know it was going to move? Because it was so close to you?"

Speaker 2:
"Yes, it was very close, and it had already moved towards the dashed line, so I knew it was going to turn right. It didn't signal, but we were almost side by side."

Speaker 1:
"At that point, I misunderstood and thought I needed to turn here."

Speaker 2:
"I ended up on the side road with the dashed lines, but those lines weren't for changing lanes. They were for the entrance to a building. I usually only cross dashed lines when necessary. I thought I needed to turn because the GPS suddenly told me to turn right. I realized it wasn't the right place because I recognized the landmarks from my previous trips."

Speaker 1:
"Oh, I see. So you didn't make the turn."
Because the navigation system suddenly instructed me to turn right, I noticed that this wasn't the store I had passed during my first trial run. I tend to remember landmarks like that. So, I didn't turn back. Actually, it didn't matter much since there was a virtual lane ahead. Yes, you just have to manage it.

Speaker 1:
When you encounter pedestrians walking slowly, do you find it difficult to judge whether they will stop or continue walking?

Speaker 2:
I judge the distance because I can usually adjust my speed based on their walking pace. I also consider traffic efficiency. If every car had to wait for every pedestrian, it would be very inefficient.

Speaker 1:
What do you do when there are many people crossing the street? If you wait for one person, everyone else might rush in. How do you handle that?

Speaker 2:
If I'm making a right turn, I judge the position of the first person on the crosswalk. If they haven't crossed halfway, I can usually make the turn without affecting them. But if they have crossed halfway, I wait. I don't want to create a direct conflict where we both hesitate, causing everyone else to rush in. It's more efficient to wait and signal my intention to let them pass. This way, people tend to cross faster. When there's a conflict, it slows everyone down.

Speaker 1:
People won't rush if they sense a conflict. They might think you're in a standoff with the pedestrian and take advantage of the situation to cross.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If I intentionally stop to let people pass, they appreciate it and move faster. When I'm walking, I also feel this way. If a driver competes with me, I slow down. If they stop for me, I appreciate it and move quickly.

Speaker 1:
That makes sense. Let's move on to some other questions. Can you recall any other driving experiences, not just this one?

Speaker 2:
What emotions do I fear most while driving? I fear encountering vehicles going the wrong way. This includes cars, motorcycles, and electric bikes. It's terrifying, especially on two-way roads where they might not slow down while borrowing your lane. This is particularly dangerous on mountain roads. Some drivers in luxury cars might do this, leaving me no space to maneuver and protect myself. If I don't yield, we could both be in serious trouble. I have to take action, but sometimes there's no space to do so, especially on narrow two-way roads. This is what I fear the most.
Speaker 1:
If you don't yield, both of you could be in trouble. Yes, I have to take the initiative, but sometimes there's no space to do so, especially on two-way streets. This is why I find driving against traffic the scariest. So, having barriers on the road, while inconvenient for pedestrians, helps with U-turns and turns.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it can be inconvenient, but it's the quickest way to avoid oncoming traffic. Besides driving against traffic...

Speaker 1:
Another scary situation is when the car in front suddenly stops without any warning. You have to react in a split second because the car behind you will be held responsible if there's a collision. 

Speaker 2:
I also fear parked cars suddenly opening their doors. If you're the driver and there's a car behind you...

Speaker 1:
Yes, especially when you're driving past parked cars and someone opens the door on the left side. It really happens.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. That's why I tend to stay more to the left. I always anticipate that something unexpected might happen on my right. But staying too far left can also be dangerous because it brings you closer to oncoming traffic, which can be uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
Do you think you change lanes quickly enough? Especially when merging into traffic, do you hesitate?

Speaker 2:
I think I'm okay with that. At least it's not dangerous. Do you think there are situations that feel dangerous when driving?

Speaker 1:
Not really, I usually don't speed. But when I'm a passenger, I notice...

Speaker 2:
Some drivers like to drive very close to the right side. From their perspective, the distance to the left seems fine, but it feels risky to me, especially on winding roads or bridges. It feels like we're about to scrape something. As a driver, you have a better sense of the space on your left, but as a passenger, it can feel like you're too close to the right.

Speaker 1:
Yes, especially in places with columns, like parking lots. It's easy to scrape the right side because you're trying to avoid the left.

Speaker 2:
When you drive, do you pay attention to legal matters? Not just today, but generally.

Speaker 1:
In the first year of driving, I was more cautious. But now, I drive more steadily.

Speaker 2:
I see. So, today...
**Speaker 1:**
The year you started driving, it was a bit rough at first, but later on, you became more stable. 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's true.

**Speaker 1:**
So, today, since you mentioned you were particularly attentive, do you think you made any extra efforts? I remember there was a bicycle incident. Can you recall that?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I remember. The bicycle suddenly swerved in front of me.

**Speaker 1:**
But if you look closely, it wasn't that sudden. There was still quite a distance between you two. Was it the same person?

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, yes, you're right. He swerved because he was adjusting his mask.

**Speaker 1:**
That startled you, didn't it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it did. It was quite scary when I saw it. 

**Speaker 1:**
Then you made a left turn, right? And you noticed an electric bike coming from the right side. So, did you do anything special for the comfort of your passengers today?

**Speaker 2:**
If it were my own car, I would have done more. But since I'm not familiar with this car, I didn't do much.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. It must have been challenging for you. Why did you veer to the right?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't remember. Are you sure I did?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you did. You were almost off the road.

**Speaker 2:**
I really don't remember which road this was. Oh, now I recall. The road itself was curving to the right, but I overcompensated. 

**Speaker 1:**
Were you distracted or did you lose control?

**Speaker 2:**
I must have forgotten. Without watching the video, I can't recall. I did make a slight right turn, which was normal since I needed to turn right. Maybe I misjudged where to turn.

**Speaker 1:**
You realized it too late, and then you had to wait. 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite annoying. I had to stick to the right side to ensure the car behind me could pass. Then I gradually moved back to the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
You turned directly into the main road because you needed to make a U-turn ahead, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.
**Speaker 1:**
When merging onto the main road, I usually go straight into the nearest lane. Then, if I need to make a U-turn ahead, I stay in that lane. So, what do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it's important to drive as fast as conditions allow when the road is clear. Also, being very familiar with the roads you frequently travel is crucial. If you need to use navigation in your own city, that's not a good sign. You should know the road conditions well. Experienced drivers are particularly good at merging into traffic. They can judge the gaps and merge smoothly, which is a significant skill difference. Many people hesitate to merge because they worry about the speed of the cars behind them or fear being honked at.

**Speaker 1:**
So, experienced drivers are better at maintaining safe distances, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they are very good at controlling the distance between cars. They also manage their speed well, using the accelerator and brake efficiently. When merging, they can judge whether the car behind will catch up before they complete the merge, which helps them avoid responsibility for any potential accidents. They also need to be thick-skinned because they might get honked at after merging.

**Speaker 2:**
These are skills of experienced drivers. Other tasks, like parking, become easier with practice. What do you think about self-driving cars and merging?

**Speaker 1:**
Self-driving cars will likely be programmed not to merge aggressively. They will follow strict rules and won't take the same liberties as human drivers. Humans can sometimes bend the rules if they think they won't get caught, but self-driving cars will always follow the rules strictly.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. Humans might take a chance if they think they can get away with it, but self-driving cars will always aim for a perfect score in terms of rule-following. For example, if I'm driving and a pedestrian steps in front of me, I might make eye contact and signal for them to let me pass. But a self-driving car will stop as soon as it detects the pedestrian, regardless of whether the pedestrian intends to let the car go first.

**Speaker 1:**
So, besides eye contact or hand signals, how else do you judge the intentions of pedestrians or other drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
I often use the side mirrors to observe the behavior of cars next to me. If a car is keeping pace with me, I can usually see if the driver is distracted, like looking at their phone. This helps me anticipate their actions.
**Speaker 1:**
I noticed that the car next to me was driving parallel for a long time. I kept checking my mirrors to see what was going on inside that car. Often, I see drivers looking at their phones, not paying attention to the road, which is why their car starts drifting.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's unusual for two cars to drive parallel for an extended period. Normally, one car should be faster or slower, even if there are two lanes. If someone is driving parallel to me, I wonder what they are up to.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. For instance, if I need to make a U-turn or merge into a side road, I wonder if the other drivers will let me in. These are things you need to watch out for.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you need to be aware of these situations. Usually, they will let you in if it doesn't affect them.

**Speaker 1:**
My main concern is the cars on this side. I judge the direction of the entire car and the driver. If they are not planning to turn back, I can make my move. 

**Speaker 2:**
How did you handle that car earlier? It seemed like it wanted to move into your lane.

**Speaker 1:**
It wasn't a problem. He stayed in his lane, and I stayed in mine. I left enough space for him. As long as the car is behind me, I don't worry. Even if there's a minor collision, it wouldn't be my fault.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think you drove well today?

**Speaker 1:**
I think so. We can ask others for their opinions later, but I feel confident about my driving.

**Speaker 2:**
If I were a passenger in such road conditions, I would feel the same way.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I have to go now. Is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's all for now. We just need you to fill out a form for the experiment compensation. You can send it to me later via WeChat.

**Speaker 1:**
Sure, I can do that. I'll stop the recording now. Thank you.

**Speaker 2:**
No problem. I'll handle the rest. You can leave the meeting room when you're ready.
