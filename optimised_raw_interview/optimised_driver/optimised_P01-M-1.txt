**Speaker 1:**
During your driving experience, did you pay attention to the passengers' comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Honestly, I knew they might feel uncomfortable, so I made sure not to brake too hard.

**Speaker 1:**
But you felt the brakes weren't good?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. The brakes weren't very responsive because it wasn't a car I was familiar with.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the brakes didn't work well when you pressed them lightly, and then they suddenly became too hard?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite uncomfortable. I felt the car didn't respond the way I wanted, especially with the unpredictable traffic and pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:**
It sounds like you were in a complex situation with both motorized and non-motorized vehicles, and you had to make a turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and an electric bike even gave way to me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to move forward.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were constantly monitoring the surroundings?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I had to merge onto the main road, which was quite busy. There was also a large vehicle that didn't slow down, so I had to wait for it to pass before I could proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
I see, and you let them go first?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I let them go because I could tell they wanted to move into the right lane to make a turn.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you know their intention?

**Speaker 2:**
They were very close to me, and I could see they were moving towards the dashed line, indicating a right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Even though they didn't signal?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they didn't signal, and we were already side by side.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you misunderstood the navigation and took the wrong turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the navigation suddenly instructed me to turn right, and I mistook the location. I usually recognize landmarks, but I continued on the side road instead.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think driving slowly in such situations makes it harder to judge the traffic?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes driving slowly can make it more challenging to assess the situation accurately.
Speaker 1:
In situations where vehicles are moving slowly, do you find it difficult to judge whether they are going to stop or continue moving?

Speaker 2:
I mainly judge the distance. If I can adjust my speed in time, I don't need to wait. I also consider traffic efficiency. If every car had to wait at every pedestrian crossing, it would be very inefficient.

Speaker 1:
What do you do when there are many people trying to cross the road? If you wait for one person, everyone else might rush in. How do you improve your efficiency in such cases?

Speaker 2:
If I'm making a right turn, I judge the position of the first person on the crosswalk. If they haven't crossed halfway, I can usually make the turn without affecting them. If they have crossed halfway, I wait to avoid a direct conflict. If I wait and signal my intention to let them pass, people tend to cross faster. When there's a conflict, everyone slows down, almost as if challenging each other.

Speaker 1:
Can you explain that mindset? For example, if people see you waiting for someone, they might rush to cross.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I deliberately stop to let people pass, they might think, "This driver is considerate, I'll cross quickly." But if I try to rush, they might slow down out of defiance, thinking, "If you want to rush, go ahead and hit me."

Speaker 1:
Alright, let me ask you some additional questions. Can you recall any specific driving experiences where you felt particularly scared?

Speaker 2:
I'm really afraid of encountering vehicles going the wrong way. This includes pedestrians, electric bikes, and cars. It's especially scary on two-way roads when someone overtakes without slowing down. 

Speaker 1:
Is this particularly concerning on mountain roads where people might overtake?

Speaker 2:
Yes, on mountain roads, there's often no space to maneuver and protect myself. If someone overtakes without giving way, it can be very dangerous. On narrow two-lane roads, encountering a vehicle going the wrong way is my biggest fear. Having barriers on the road helps, but it's still a major concern.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you have to take the initiative to make a move, but there's no space to do so, especially on a two-lane road. I think driving against traffic is the scariest thing. So, having barriers on the road, although inconvenient for pedestrians or for making U-turns, is relatively safer.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, driving against traffic is really scary. Another thing is sudden stops. It's terrifying when the car in front of you stops suddenly without any warning.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you have to be prepared for that.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because the car behind you is responsible if there's an accident. No matter how urgently the car in front stops, it's not their fault. Another thing I fear is when parked cars suddenly open their doors.

**Speaker 1:**
That's a concern for drivers.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially when I'm driving past parked cars.

**Speaker 1:**
On the left side, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you keep a safe distance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's why I prefer to stay in the left lane. I always anticipate that something unexpected might happen on my right. But the left lane has its own dangers, like when oncoming traffic is very close.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think you have any bad driving habits?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for example, I think I'm not quick enough when changing lanes, especially when cutting in.

**Speaker 1:**
In Beijing, you often have to cut in while driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when I finally find a gap, I hesitate and can't decisively move in. My lane changes are not fast enough.

**Speaker 1:**
That's not too bad, at least it's not dangerous. Do you think you have any habits that might compromise traffic safety or make others feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
I generally don't speed. 

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger, do you notice any bad driving habits in others?

**Speaker 2:**
Some people like to drive very close to the right side.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they stay close to the right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, from the driver's perspective, they think the distance to the left is appropriate, but the right side is very close. Especially on winding bridges, it feels like the car is about to scrape the side. It's quite uncomfortable. As a driver, you should be aware of the space on your right, especially when you're sitting on the left. You can't let your fear of the left side make you ignore the right side. This is particularly important in underground parking lots with tight turns.

**Speaker 1:**
As a passenger sitting on the right, you feel very nervous, like you're about to hit something on the right.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially in parking lots with columns, it's easy to scrape the right side because the driver is trying to avoid the left side.
Speaker 1: Did you hit something on the right side?

Speaker 2: Yes, I did. In parking lots with pillars, it's easy to scrape the right side while trying to avoid the left.

Speaker 1: Do you usually pay attention to the passenger experience while driving, not just today but in general?

Speaker 2: Not really. Except for the first year when I started driving, I was a bit cautious. But now, I drive pretty steadily.

Speaker 1: So, do you think you made any extra effort today to ensure a better experience?

Speaker 2: I remember there was a bicycle that I didn't notice.

Speaker 1: What happened next?

Speaker 2: I think he swerved a bit because he was putting on a mask.

Speaker 1: Did that startle you?

Speaker 2: Yes, it did. It was quite scary when I saw it.

Speaker 1: When you were making a left turn, did you notice the changes on the right side?

Speaker 2: If it were my own car, I would have done more. But since it wasn't, I didn't feel it was necessary.

Speaker 1: Why did you veer to the right?

Speaker 2: I don't remember. I have no recollection of that.

Speaker 1: You were already on the curb.

Speaker 2: I don't even remember which road this was.

Speaker 1: It was the last road we took.

Speaker 2: Oh, now I remember.

Speaker 1: The road was curving to the right, but you veered even more to the right. If you were going straight, you should have gone left.

Speaker 2: I understand what you mean, but I don't remember why. Maybe I was daydreaming and lost control for a moment.

Speaker 1: You were supposed to turn right at that point, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, I must have misjudged where to turn. It was an instinctive reaction.

Speaker 1: You had to wait there, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was quite annoying. I was sticking to the right to ensure the car behind me had enough space.
Speaker 1:
Haha, right, you always do this.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I stick to the right side to ensure that the car behind me won't be affected. Then I gradually move over. Whenever I merge onto the main road, I do it this way. I don't like to directly merge into the innermost lane.

Speaker 1:
Into the middle lane, because you need to make a U-turn ahead, right? So you just keep driving straight. Let me ask you, what do you think makes a good or professional driver? What should they at least be able to do?

Speaker 2:
I think when the road conditions are good, you should drive a bit faster. You should be very familiar with the roads, especially in your own city. If you need to use navigation in your own city, that's not good. You should know the road conditions well.

Speaker 1:
What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

Speaker 2:
Experienced drivers are very good at merging into traffic. Their skill at merging is very high.

Speaker 1:
In this area.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's the biggest difference. Many people worry about whether there's enough space to merge, the speed of the car behind them, or getting yelled at.

Speaker 1:
So in this aspect, experienced drivers are better at controlling the distance between cars. They also have better control over their speed, including the use of the gas pedal and brakes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and they can judge the speed of the car behind them when they need to merge.

Speaker 1:
Before they merge in.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because if they merge and the car behind catches up, they could be held responsible. Also, they need to be thick-skinned because they might get honked at or yelled at after merging. These are things experienced drivers handle well. Other things like parking and maneuvering into a spot become easier with practice.

Speaker 1:
What do you think are some things that autonomous vehicles will never be able to do as well as human drivers?

Speaker 2:
Merging into traffic. Autonomous vehicles will always follow the rules strictly. 

Speaker 1:
I understand, they will always follow the rules.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they will have a complete adherence to traffic rules. They won't have the flexibility that humans do, like deciding when to follow or bend the rules. They are either 100% compliant or not at all. 

Speaker 1:
Humans might think, "Today, even if I'm not completely right, it's okay."

Speaker 2:
Exactly. For instance, if there's no camera around and I know I won't cause any consequences, I might not follow the rules strictly. But an autonomous vehicle will always follow the rules. For example, if I'm making a right turn and there's a pedestrian, I might make eye contact and signal them to let me go first. But an autonomous vehicle will always wait for the pedestrian to cross.
Speaker 1:
So, when you're driving, you often use eye contact or hand gestures to communicate, right? Besides these, how else do you judge the intentions of pedestrians or other vehicles? How do you understand each other’s intentions, apart from using turn signals?

Speaker 2:
I use the side mirrors a lot. If a car is driving parallel to me for a long time, I find it odd. I look into their car to see what's going on. Often, people driving parallel are distracted, like looking at their phones.

Speaker 1:
I see, so they’re not paying attention to their surroundings.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Normally, cars shouldn't drive parallel for long. Either they should be slower or faster than me, even if we’re on two lanes. If they stay parallel, it feels unsafe because you don’t know what they’re going to do next. For example, if I need to make a U-turn or merge into a side road, I need to see if they will let me.

Speaker 1:
Right, you need to see if they will give you space.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I judge the whole situation, including the direction of their car and their body language. If they’re not turning towards my lane, I can proceed. 

Speaker 1:
How do you judge if a car seems like it wants to move into your lane?

Speaker 2:
If they’re in their lane and I’m in mine, it’s fine. I leave enough space for them, so I’m not worried. If they’re behind me, I’m not concerned because any collision would be their fault.

Speaker 1:
Do you think you’re a good driver? We can ask others for their opinions later.

Speaker 2:
I don’t really care about others' opinions. 

Speaker 1:
Haha, I can help you ask later if you want.

Speaker 2:
I feel that passengers who don’t drive often might not understand the challenges. If I were a passenger in such traffic, I’d think the driver has a tough job, with people suddenly appearing in front of the car.

Speaker 1:
Alright, I think we’re almost done. Is there anything else you want to add?

Speaker 2:
No, I think we’ve covered everything.
Speaker 1:
It wasn't easy; people kept darting out unexpectedly.

Speaker 2:
Yeah, it was quite challenging. Is the video over now? Any other issues?

Speaker 1:
No, that's about it. The video is finished, and there aren't any major problems since we were just trying to save time.

Speaker 2:
Alright, I'll head out then.

Speaker 1:
I don't have any more questions for now. We just have an experiment-related form.

Speaker 2:
Got it.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. You might need to fill it out, or you can send it to me later. You can add me on WeChat and send it to me afterward. You can take this paper with you.

Speaker 2:
Oh, sure. I can take a photo of it too.

Speaker 1:
Alright, I'll stop the recording now. Thank you.

Speaker 2:
Thank you.
