**Text Record:**

**Speaker 1:**
The sound is also low.

**Speaker 1:**
There is a bit of an echo, but it's okay.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you adjust the microphone? Hello, hello, hello, why is there no sound on my end? It's gone. Hello, hello, I haven't disconnected, I checked the mic.

**Speaker 2:**
The sunlight is indeed quite strong, and the quality is seriously affected. The response is still acceptable.

**Speaker 2:**
You can add this to your door. Yes, then we can turn on the microphone on your computer. Is it on? Did I turn it on? Yes, it will be broadcast.

**Speaker 2:**
This is like the universe you mentioned earlier. If you are ready, I will address the final buffering issue in a few days. Okay, hello, my name is [Name], and I will be responsible for today's session. We will watch some TikTok habits together, and we can pause at interesting points to discuss the details. I will ask you some specific questions, and you can share your thoughts. If there are any questions you don't want to answer, feel free to let me know. All the data we use will be anonymized and your personal information will not be disclosed. Thank you for your support. I will start with some basic questions. You mentioned that you have been driving for a long time. Can you tell me what types of cars you have driven? You said you have driven many different kinds of cars.

**Speaker 1:**
I haven't driven a sports car, but I have experience with most of the other types you mentioned. I've driven off-road vehicles, SUVs, and some business cars.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you have driven them for a while?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, or at least I have had some experience with them. For example, the Paladin, a four-wheel-drive off-road vehicle, and the Land Cruiser.

**Speaker 2:**
Highlander?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, and also the Tiguan. These are mostly off-road series.

**Speaker 2:**
Have you driven electric cars?

**Speaker 1:**
Pure electric ones? Yes, like BYD.

**Speaker 2:**
The Song model, and also hybrids?

**Speaker 1:**
I haven't driven hybrids, no experience with them.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay, so you have driven sedans the most?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the most.

**Speaker 2:**
Have you driven cars with driver assistance features?

**Speaker 1:**
Driver assistance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, features like automatic lane-keeping or other assistive technologies.
Speaker 1: How was your experience with the car?

Speaker 2: It wasn't about learning to drive; it was more about the assisted driving features. For example, it can automatically keep you in the center of the lane or maintain your speed.

Speaker 1: On the highway, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, on the highway. You can even take your foot off the gas, and it will maintain the speed for you.

Speaker 1: Like an automatic cruise control. And it can also apply the brakes if you're too close to the car in front.

Speaker 2: Exactly, it can suddenly brake for you.

Speaker 1: Yes, it can give you a sudden brake.

Speaker 2: Have you driven a car with these features before? Do you have a strong impression of it?

Speaker 1: Yes, I have. Sometimes, it can interfere with your driving, especially in the city when you're close to other cars. You can't just rely on it at traffic lights. The system's settings might not always match your driving style.

Speaker 2: Do you think the distance it maintains is too wide?

Speaker 1: Not necessarily. It depends on your speed. If you're going fast and get too close, it will brake. If you're going slow and stay close, it won't.

Speaker 2: So, over 80 km/h, it might feel like you have control, but the system thinks otherwise.

Speaker 1: Yes, it might brake even if you feel in control.

Speaker 2: I see. So, even with these features, you might prefer to rely on your own judgment because you trust your experience more.

Speaker 1: Exactly. I used to rely on my own skills and experience. Now, with these new features, you have to adjust. You can't follow cars too closely anymore. You need to plan your moves earlier and take different routes if necessary.

Speaker 2: Since you mentioned you have a strong impression, did you test drive or have long-term experience with such cars?

Speaker 1: Yes, our company recently upgraded to these new models.

Speaker 2: Oh, so you switched to new cars with these features?

Speaker 1: Yes, all the new models have these features.

Speaker 2: Do you remember which model specifically? Was it a Buick?

Speaker 1: Yes, it was a Buick. I think it was the LaCrosse. The older models didn't have these features, but the newer ones do.

Speaker 2: Got it. Do you drive more in the city or on highways? I remember you mentioned you have extensive driving experience in both.

Speaker 1: It's about half and half. I often drive between cities as well.

Speaker 2: And you mentioned you're a professional driver, right?
**Speaker 1:**
Even if it's halfway, it's often between cities.

**Speaker 2:**
You mentioned that you are a professional driver for high-ranking officials. Could you share some of your experiences driving important passengers?

**Speaker 1:**
Our company has collaborated with Qatar and Dubai, working with people from the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. They come here to work with us, bringing many foreign experts, including Germans and people from Dubai. We often serve these experts. In our area, there are no five-star hotels, but they require such accommodations. If they don't stay in five-star hotels, they won't pay or provide allowances. So, they must stay in five-star hotels, and later, they won't reimburse the expenses.

**Speaker 2:**
I mean, could you share some of your driving experiences?

**Speaker 1:**
They stay about 50-60 kilometers away from us. Every morning, I drive to pick them up and then take them to the site or meeting venue. They often stay in five-star hotels far away.

**Speaker 2:**
When driving important passengers, what aspects do you pay special attention to?

**Speaker 1:**
For Germans, punctuality is crucial. They usually come out of the hotel two minutes early. I always arrive 10 minutes early. The car must be clean and tidy, without any dust or dirt. For other countries, safety is a priority. They are often scared by the way people cross the street in China and by reckless driving. So, it's important to drive steadily, maintain a safe distance, and avoid sudden maneuvers that might scare them.

**Speaker 2:**
To ensure the comfort and satisfaction of important clients, what specific measures do you take while driving, besides maintaining a safe distance and avoiding frequent overtaking?

**Speaker 1:**
I try to maintain a steady speed. When turning, I pay attention to inertia. Sometimes, it's not just about braking to counteract centrifugal force; a slight acceleration can help. If you brake or turn sharply, passengers might feel the car swaying. A gentle acceleration can make the turn smoother and more comfortable for them.
**Speaker 1:**
When he's in the car, if you brake or turn, he leans to one side. But if you gently press the accelerator and speed up, he stabilizes and doesn't feel the swaying. So, when driving, you need to consider the psychology of pedestrians, children, and the elderly. For example, how would a normal person react when crossing the street? You need to anticipate these actions.

**Speaker 2:**
I understand. So, when you're turning, you need to slow down first, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, slow down in advance.

**Speaker 2:**
But since you're turning, you need to maintain a constant speed through the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, maintain that speed.

**Speaker 2:**
So, during the test, you should apply a bit of throttle to make it feel smoother.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
If you keep braking, it might feel uncomfortable because the forward momentum suddenly shifts to the side.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the centrifugal force changes, and it can be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
So, it's about gradually changing the speed from forward to sideways, and you mentioned applying a bit of throttle to ensure a smooth transition.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the speed can counteract the centrifugal force.

**Speaker 2:**
Instead of braking hard and then accelerating again after the turn, which feels uncomfortable. I think that's what you mean.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, that's the idea. You need to counteract the centrifugal force. Some turns are downhill or uphill, but most are flat. For example, a 180-degree turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Whether you're exiting or turning, you need to navigate the curve smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, many people feel uncomfortable on curves.

**Speaker 2:**
I've noticed that some drivers prefer to stay on the inside of the curve. Does that reduce the centrifugal force compared to staying on the outside?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, staying on the inside reduces the angle of the turn.

**Speaker 2:**
So, staying on the inside feels less intense?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, because the angle is smaller. On the outside, the angle is larger.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you think staying on the inside requires less adjustment?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, look at motorcycle racers; they always take the inside line. They never take the outside because the centrifugal force is much greater on the outside. The larger the turn, the greater the centrifugal force.

**Speaker 2:**
Got it.
Speaker 1:
The larger the turn you make, the greater the centrifugal force. If you take the inside lane, the centrifugal force is smaller because the radius is smaller. You need to stay close to the inside.

Speaker 2:
Got it. Besides these points, is there anything else? Apart from handling curves, like you mentioned earlier, driving steadily and maintaining a constant speed?

Speaker 1:
There are a few types of vehicles you shouldn't follow closely, like buses and taxis. You should avoid getting sandwiched between them. Either overtake them or keep a safe distance. If they are driving parallel to you, find a way to avoid them. Don't weave in and out of their space because they have many blind spots.

Speaker 2:
Understood. Is there anything else that left a deep impression on you, something you pay special attention to?

Speaker 1:
Well, the topic is quite broad. If you ask about specific experiences...

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially those related to driving experiences.

Speaker 1:
Once, my wife was returning from Xi'an. I had a co-driver with me. He drove erratically, speeding up and slowing down, swerving left and right. It made the passengers very uncomfortable. I had been driving the whole way back and was almost home, about 100 kilometers away. After a break for food and water, he insisted on driving. The passengers even commented, "Driver, you've been driving the whole way, you shouldn't drive back as well." He didn't know his own skill level and took the wheel. On the road, he kept changing speeds and failed to overtake properly. For instance, he would drive parallel to a large bus at the same speed. I told him, "Why are you driving parallel to the bus? Either slow down or speed up and overtake it. If the bus driver can't see you and there's an emergency, he won't be able to react in time." His erratic driving on the highway, constantly crossing the lines, made the passengers very uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
Crossing the lines?

Speaker 1:
Yes, either driving on the line or straddling it. Many drivers do this, occupying two lanes. This makes passengers feel unsafe and anxious. When I drive, passengers can relax and even sleep. But when he drove, everyone was on edge, feeling very uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's a very clear example.

Speaker 1:
When passengers trust you, they can relax and even nap. If they don't trust you, they are constantly on edge. New drivers often feel exhausted on long trips because they are tense and their muscles are strained.
Speaker 1:
When you first start driving, you might feel very tense. Your muscles are stiff, and you're highly stressed. This is why new drivers often feel exhausted after a long drive. They haven't yet learned to relax while driving. When I first started, I was the same way—tense and nervous. This is also why new drivers are more prone to accidents.

Speaker 2:
The more nervous you are...

Speaker 1:
The more likely you are to make mistakes. In an emergency, you might panic and not know what to do. For example, you might not instinctively lift your foot off the gas pedal and press the brake. It's important to stay relaxed, especially on long trips. The longest trip I've done alone was 1,650 kilometers.

Speaker 2:
Did you complete that in one day?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I drove from Shenyang to Zhengzhou, which is 1,600 kilometers, in one go. Another time, I drove from Zhengzhou to Ningbo, which is 1,400 kilometers, in just over 10 hours. I started at 8 AM and arrived after 10 PM.

Speaker 2:
Alright, so you chose our vehicle for this trip.

Speaker 1:
Yes, the car needs maintenance, like an oil change. The warning light keeps coming on.

Speaker 2:
Is it the front wheels?

Speaker 1:
The steering feels heavy. It could be an alignment issue or low tire pressure. If the tire pressure is low, the steering will feel heavy. The steering angle on this car is also quite small.

Speaker 2:
You mean when turning?

Speaker 1:
Yes, when turning. With most cars, I can make a turn in one go, but with this car, I can't. The steering angle is too small.

Speaker 2:
So you have to reverse a bit to complete the turn?

Speaker 1:
Yes, because the car has a long front end. You can't make the turn without reversing.

Speaker 2:
The car has a long front end, but the interior space doesn't feel that big.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, it's not very spacious. It's even lower than a Chevrolet. In my Chevrolet, I can adjust the seat and still have headroom.

Speaker 2:
I see. Let's take a look at your perspective. This red dot represents where you were looking. It moves with your eyes.

Speaker 1:
When I start driving, I always check for oncoming traffic and any obstacles on the right side. I monitor the road conditions.

Speaker 2:
It might be a bit off, but that's okay.

Speaker 1:
No, you need to guide me. Maybe that's why it feels shaky.

Speaker 2:
Oh, it might be a bit loose. When you move your eyes, it tracks them. I have a question. When new drivers are behind the wheel, they often find it hard to judge the distance between the car and the right side, whether it's the door or the wheels. How do you handle that, especially since this is your first time driving this car?
**Speaker 1:**
When driving, it's often difficult to judge the distance on the right side, whether it's the car door or the wheels and the distance to the curb on a right turn. Since it's your first time driving this car, I think you handled it very well, especially on the right side.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you mentioned my right front wheel. How far was it from the curb?

**Speaker 1:**
Right, or just now when you were recovering, there was a bit of a gap, or rather, most of the time.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I noticed that. How do others usually judge this distance?

**Speaker 1:**
Generally, for larger vehicles, if the front of the car can pass, the rest will follow. As long as the front passes, the rear will follow through. For sedans, it's usually aligned with the driver's shoulder.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you mean when your ear is aligned with the curb, you can be sure the rear will pass?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly. When your ear passes the curb, the rear will follow. You can judge by looking at your position relative to the curb. If your ear is past it, the rear will be too.

**Speaker 2:**
Got it. And for the front wheels, how do you judge the distance between cars?

**Speaker 1:**
You can use the corner of the windshield wiper as a reference. Wherever the corner points, that's where your front wheel will be.

**Speaker 2:**
I see. During the entire process, especially in parking lots with many turns, what driving habits do you think are important?

**Speaker 1:**
I'm not too worried about left turns because my field of vision is wide. I can see clearly with the left mirror. But right turns have a bit of a blind spot.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the right rearview mirror doesn't always show if someone is coming.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. You can only see within about 5 meters behind the mirror. Beyond that, you can't see if someone is approaching from the side road.

**Speaker 2:**
Unless they are already very close to your car, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, and if an electric bike is coming fast, it can be dangerous. They might not yield, and you could easily bump into them. In cities, trees can also block your view, so you need to be constantly prepared. When approaching a side road, you need to anticipate if someone might come out.

**Speaker 2:**
You mentioned the rearview mirror doesn't show everything. How do you check in advance?

**Speaker 1:**
When you're about to turn, your line of sight is forward, but you can use your peripheral vision to check the side road. You need to be aware of what's ahead in the next 20 meters or so.

**Speaker 2:**
Understood. Thank you for the tips.
**Speaker 1:**
Can you see the side road with your peripheral vision when you're about 20 meters from the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, keep an eye on this stretch of road. By the time you make the turn, the vehicle behind you will have caught up.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, so...

**Speaker 2:**
If there's a vehicle, you wait for it. If not, you proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
In the city, it's different now.

**Speaker 2:**
You need to anticipate and check the right side in advance.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you need to anticipate. Even if there are no cars, you should slow down if the road is slippery.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you find left turns easier?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, left turns are easy. I always check the rearview mirror after turning left. But...

**Speaker 2:**
When I drive, whether it's a left or right turn, I worry about one thing. For example, if there's a fast lane ahead and I need to merge, I have to be cautious. If I'm turning right, I need to watch for cyclists or pedestrians on the right. I also need to be aware of the fast-moving traffic on the left because they might not yield to me. Timing is crucial, and sometimes it can be challenging to manage.

**Speaker 1:**
In such situations, just wait a bit longer.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, wait until there are fewer cars on the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, waiting a bit longer won't hurt. Sometimes rushing through traffic lights in the city doesn't save time. Maintaining a steady speed is more efficient.

**Speaker 2:**
Let's consider this scenario: you can't see if there are any oncoming cars from the other side. How do you handle that?

**Speaker 1:**
If it's not an electric vehicle but a car, you...

**Speaker 2:**
You can't always know if there's a car coming.

**Speaker 1:**
From this angle, once my car's front is out, I can see if there's a car. Usually, if a car is close, it will yield to me.

**Speaker 2:**
And you check the right side in advance?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I like to observe the left side first when entering an intersection.

**Speaker 2:**
Then you look to the right.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I check if there are any cars or cyclists behind me. Sometimes, I adjust the right mirror to get a better view.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you also check for pedestrians?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I make sure to look out for them.

**Speaker 2:**
Got it. Now, we're approaching the side road...
Speaker 1:
Yes, I have noticed.

Speaker 2:
No new drivers or anything like that? Got it. So, right now, we are in the front, handling the assistance part. This section of the road can be quite complex. On the right, there are non-motorized vehicles and a three-wheeler coming up.

Speaker 1:
Yes, and they can be quite unpredictable, right?

Speaker 2:
This three-wheeler is taking up a lot of space. You’re already driving close to the edge of the road.

Speaker 1:
I’ll keep a safe distance and move quickly. That driver seems to be looking around a lot.

Speaker 2:
We need to merge onto the main road. First, check the left and rear, but the bushes are blocking the view.

Speaker 1:
You can’t see smaller cars because of that.

Speaker 2:
But you should be able to see larger vehicles.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I see them. I intentionally slowed down.

Speaker 2:
When your view is obstructed by greenery and you can’t see the main road clearly, what do you usually do?

Speaker 1:
I usually slow down when I get to this point because there are lane markings to guide you.

Speaker 2:
Check if there are no cars behind. Then, look at the cars behind you.

Speaker 1:
There’s a car behind us. Let it pass, then merge.

Speaker 2:
Got it. I noticed you have a good habit. Some drivers, knowing they need to turn ahead, will switch two lanes at once. But you switch one lane at a time.

Speaker 1:
It’s not allowed to switch two lanes at once.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that’s a fineable offense.

Speaker 1:
Ideally, you should switch one lane at a time, even on highways. If there are no cameras, some might take the risk, but it’s not advisable.

Speaker 2:
This is a stretch where you can maintain a constant speed. What speed do you usually maintain on such roads?

Speaker 1:
On roads like this, I usually drive at 60 km/h.

Speaker 2:
And what about the distance between your car and the one in front?

Speaker 1:
I always maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 2:
Approximately how far?

Speaker 1:
At 60 km/h, I’d say around 20-30 meters.

Speaker 2:
20-30 meters?

Speaker 1:
Yes, because sudden braking can be dangerous. I prefer to brake gradually.

Speaker 2:
So, at this moment, the distance between you and the car in front is about 20 meters, I think.

Speaker 1:
It looks more than 20 meters to me.

Speaker 2:
Maybe around 15 meters?

Speaker 1:
No, it’s more like 5-6 meters. It’s quite close.
**Speaker 2:**
At this point, it's about 20 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
No, it's not 20 meters.

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe 15 meters?

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, it's more like five or six meters. It passed by. You mean the taxi?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the taxi.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, that's about 20 meters.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, around 20 meters. Got it. And then there's a U-turn ahead.

**Speaker 2:**
I noticed that when you made the U-turn here, you first turned the steering wheel slightly to the right.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, when we were passing by, you didn't make it through.

**Speaker 2:**
What? Then you remembered, and I turned to the right.

**Speaker 1:**
I turned the wheel and stayed close to the line.

**Speaker 2:**
Staying close to the line gives you more space to make the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
This time, I felt like I made the turn in one go.

**Speaker 2:**
You turned the steering wheel. Yes, you made it in one go. So, I can note this down and summarize it later. So, during a typical U-turn, what is your usual approach? Let's not talk about the maximum steering angle for now. What do you particularly pay attention to?

**Speaker 1:**
First, I look at how many cars are on my side. On my right, I check the straight-going cars and stay close to the line. Then I look at the oncoming traffic.

**Speaker 2:**
You mean the distance to the main lane on your right. Since you are in the left-turn lane, you try to stay close to the straight-going lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, a little bit. But you have to consider the width of the road. If the road is wide, you don't need to squeeze in. If the road is narrow, you have to stay close to the right.

**Speaker 2:**
And what about other factors, like oncoming traffic or the flow of cars?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you have to yield to oncoming traffic. The left-turn lane is the weakest, so you have to give way.

**Speaker 2:**
For example, when we were test driving, we didn't make it in one go. We had to wait for the oncoming traffic, especially near the bus stop.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the bus driver even asked us a question.

**Speaker 2:**
Right.

**Speaker 1:**
It was the first time making that turn, and the steering angle was so small. I didn't expect it to be that small, so I didn't make it in one go. Many cars, like Audis, can make it in one go.

**Speaker 2:**
I think it might be due to the wheelbase.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like the steering angle of American cars is smaller than that of German cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, right.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you can check it. I remember the steering angle of the D80 I used to drive was around 27 or 28 degrees. It could make the turn like a Jinbei van. Japanese extended cars can make the turn in one go because their steering angle is larger, making the turn easier.
Speaker 1:
When driving the D80, you can achieve a steering angle of around 27-28 degrees. Compared to a Jinbei van, which can make sharp turns easily, the Japanese extended car can also handle turns smoothly due to its larger steering angle. For instance, in Hong Kong, container trucks can maneuver through tight corners effortlessly, but our car struggles because of its limited steering angle. If you try to force it, you might end up damaging the vehicle.

Speaker 2:
And then there's another right turn ahead.

Speaker 1:
Now, you need to pay attention to the people over there. Look at the intersection; you need to prepare to turn.

Speaker 2:
So, I need to be aware of the people at the intersection.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. You need to watch the people, but also keep an eye on the driver.

Speaker 2:
You didn't look that way.

Speaker 1:
Your peripheral vision should still be focused ahead.

Speaker 2:
I noticed that you were watching the taxi in your rearview mirror when it appeared.

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's right.

Speaker 2:
At that moment, you sensed it was going to change lanes, so you slowed down.

Speaker 1:
Yes, with taxis, you shouldn't compete with them. They are in a hurry to make a living. If you get too close, they might make a sudden move, which can be dangerous.

Speaker 2:
I saw that you had already anticipated the taxi's lane change.

Speaker 1:
Yes, but...

Speaker 2:
Did it signal?

Speaker 1:
I didn't notice the signal, but it got very close in my mirror, and the light flashed.

Speaker 2:
So, you slowed down.

Speaker 2:
At this point, the grass on the right blocked your view, and you couldn't see anything from the right side mirror.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I had to get closer to the auxiliary road.

Speaker 2:
You couldn't see anything, so you looked ahead a bit.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I had to rely on the bridge ahead.

Speaker 2:
But you still felt a bit uneasy.

Speaker 1:
Yes, there was nothing visible on that side.

Speaker 2:
Oh, at this point, you were using the rear window and the side window to check.

Speaker 1:
Yes, since the side mirror couldn't show the angle, I had to look through the rear window.

Speaker 2:
I noticed that you might have changed to the left lane at this point.

Speaker 1:
Yes, there was an arrow indicating to move to this side.

Speaker 2:
Because the road ahead merges into one lane.

Speaker 1:
But after moving forward, it splits again. The road markings are confusing; you see people moving back and forth.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it changes from two lanes to one lane again.
**Speaker 1:**
When we got to the front, we had to turn back. The road markings were confusing. You see, he walked forward and then turned back.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it turned into two lanes and then back into one lane. So, we were a bit unsure whether we needed to signal to change lanes or just follow the road.

**Speaker 1:**
Ideally, signaling is always good. Since there were no other cars behind us, only the car following us, it's unlikely another car would come and take the lane. Except for that one spot. It's a single-lane U-turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright, let's proceed to the next entrance.

**Speaker 2:**
I have a question. The video doesn't have any bugs now. To ensure safe driving, what areas did you particularly focus on during this drive?

**Speaker 1:**
At intersections, you need to observe carefully and yield when necessary.

**Speaker 2:**
We previously emphasized this point. Do you feel you paid more attention to certain aspects compared to your usual driving?

**Speaker 1:**
How should I put it?

**Speaker 2:**
Like using turn signals.

**Speaker 1:**
In Beijing, driving is relatively orderly since it's the capital. But in other cities, it's different. People tend to cut in, and you have to yield. They aren't afraid of you; they think you won't dare to hit them. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, if you yield to pedestrians, they will keep crossing in large numbers. So, when the light turns green, pedestrians will move aside, and you can go.

**Speaker 2:**
I noticed the same in Guangdong and Shenzhen.

**Speaker 1:**
I've driven in Shenzhen for a few years, and it feels like the traffic flow is faster.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, in Shenzhen, if there's no signal, cars will go. But if there is a signal, cars and pedestrians follow the rules.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, both cars and pedestrians follow the rules.

**Speaker 2:**
There are rarely any violations.

**Speaker 1:**
From a distance, pedestrians will avoid cars because of the awareness campaigns.

**Speaker 2:**
At this point, our navigation system had an issue, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, my navigation wasn't working.

**Speaker 2:**
But you remembered the route.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I remembered the route.

**Speaker 2:**
When we turned right, that electric bike sped up.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I knew it would, so I let it pass. I wasn't comfortable until it did.

**Speaker 2:**
This is a good practice, letting others go first. Can you recall any situations during your usual driving that made you particularly anxious or fearful?
Person 2:
Hmm, so this is a well-trafficked road, let's start with that. Can you recall any situations while driving that made you feel scared or think it was dangerous?

Person 1:
If there's a large bus or truck and I need to overtake it, I'm afraid it might suddenly swerve or that an electric bike might come out of nowhere. You know, like from the side of the road.

Person 2:
You mean from the right side?

Person 1:
Yes, if it's parked on the side of the road. If the road is clear and there aren't many people, you can overtake it. But you always have to be prepared for the possibility that someone might suddenly step out in front of the vehicle.

Person 2:
Oh, I get it. So there's a truck parked there, and you need to be cautious.

Person 1:
Yes, exactly. But you never know if someone might be near the truck.

Person 2:
You have to be careful when passing the front or the back of the truck because of the blind spots. You can't see if someone suddenly steps out.

Person 1:
Yes, exactly. This is what we call the "ghost head" scenario.

Person 2:
Right, like if there's a truck or a bus, and someone suddenly appears from the front, you wouldn't see them until it's too late.

Person 1:
Yes, especially at bus stops. When a bus is stopped, someone might suddenly run across the road to catch another bus or get to the other side. They can run very fast, and it's dangerous.

Person 2:
Or when someone is just starting to cross the street at an intersection, trying to beat the red light. You might have a green light, but they could still be in your blind spot.

Person 1:
Yes, you have to be very careful in those situations.

Person 2:
Besides these "ghost head" scenarios, are there any other situations that you find particularly dangerous? Especially in urban areas?

Person 1:
Well, on highways, you might suddenly see a wild animal like a pheasant or a sheep jump out from the side of the road. I've seen that happen.

Person 2:
From the side of the road?

Person 1:
Yes, they can come from the grassy areas between the lanes. There are often barriers and greenery, and animals can get scared by the noise of large vehicles and run across the road.

Person 2:
Between the lanes, you mean?

Person 1:
Yes, between the lanes. The barriers and greenery can hide animals, and they might suddenly run out in front of you. I've seen a sheep jump out in front of my car on the highway.

Person 2:
Where did it jump from?

Person 1:
From the middle of the road, where the barriers are.

Person 2:
I need to start a new recording.

Person 2:
Alright, let's continue. So, back to the dangerous scenarios we were discussing. Adela encountered a problem. Actually, this...
Speaker 2:
Alright, alright, let's continue. So, let's go back to the dangerous scenario we were discussing earlier. Adela encountered a problem. Yes, this is one of those situations where a person suddenly appears from behind a car. You couldn't see them beforehand. 

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. At that moment, it was already quite dangerous, but fortunately, the person didn't continue crossing the street.

Speaker 2:
This is exactly the kind of situation you mentioned earlier, where you have to assess the situation.

Speaker 1:
Yes, you have to keep an eye on them, observe if they are paying attention to you. Some people are just glued to their phones and don't look around.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
In such cases...

Speaker 2:
You need to be cautious. For instance, I noticed you slightly turned the steering wheel to the left.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I saw that the person noticed me and stopped moving forward.

Speaker 2:
We were near a school, right? Did you intentionally slow down?

Speaker 1:
Yes, the first time I passed by, there was a barrier.

Speaker 2:
Right.

Speaker 1:
So, I had to slow down.

Speaker 2:
Let's review the entrance again. There were no traffic signals at that entrance, correct?

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's right. I had to be cautious because there was oncoming traffic.

Speaker 2:
So, you let them go first?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I slowed down to let them pass.

Speaker 2:
How did you signal them to go first?

Speaker 1:
By reducing my speed. The road was wide enough, so I slowed down to let them pass.

Speaker 2:
Where exactly?

Speaker 2:
On the right side, the speed was very slow. But I was also cautious because I wasn't sure if they might suddenly turn left again.

Speaker 1:
Yes, the first time we went there, it was a bit confusing. I thought they might be waiting for someone.

Speaker 2:
If it were me, I would be quite nervous in such a situation, especially if the left side is often difficult to manage.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it's tricky. You can't just stop. Ideally, they shouldn't park at the intersection. If I overtake them and they suddenly open the door, it could be dangerous.

Speaker 2:
Exactly.

Speaker 2:
In such situations, you have to decide who goes first. 

Speaker 1:
I usually take the initiative to occupy the space first and then leave room for them.

Speaker 2:
What do you mean by "occupy the space first"?

Speaker 1:
If you don't take the space, someone else might try to overtake you.
Speaker 1:
First, you need to take this spot, then take the next one. I left some space for him, left a path.

Speaker 2:
What do you mean by taking this spot first?

Speaker 1:
If you don't take it, someone else might overtake you. When you want to overtake, you need to control the whole lane. You need to press down on it, otherwise, you can't control it.

Speaker 2:
It's hard to control the whole lane when turning.

Speaker 1:
First, you need to signal to the other driver that you want to turn. You need to turn your head in that direction.

Speaker 2:
Just a little bit.

Speaker 1:
Yes, of course. Now, the road I’m giving you is enough for you to pass safely. So, I stop here. If you don't consciously stop, you will keep inching forward. The other driver won't realize your intention. You need to show them that you want to move forward. You need to press down to a certain position, like when making a left turn, you need to press down to that position and leave enough safe distance for the other driver to pass.

Speaker 2:
So, it's like inching forward a bit to signal that you want to turn, but not too much, leaving enough space for the other driver to pass.

Speaker 1:
Exactly. If you just stop on the road, they won't know if you are going straight or turning. You need to inch forward.

Speaker 2:
Got it. Honestly, when you drive, I think your driving habits are very good. I drive similarly. So, I want to ask, when you observe other drivers, what behaviors make you feel nervous or unsafe?

Speaker 1:
Sometimes, when they follow too closely or hesitate to overtake, especially when they are in the overtaking lane but are indecisive.

Speaker 2:
Staying in the overtaking lane.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it's quite scary when they are not decisive.

Speaker 2:
I understand. So, when you are driving, do you also pay attention to the passenger experience, not just important passengers, but also regular passengers like family or friends?

Speaker 1:
Yes, everyone feels...
**Speaker 1:**
When you drive with regular passengers, like family or friends, do you pay attention to their experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, everyone seems to feel comfortable in my car.

**Speaker 1:**
They often fall asleep in your car. It means they feel safe.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. As soon as the engine starts, they fall asleep. Even if they are talking to me, they eventually doze off. This indicates that the ride is smooth and the engine sound is soothing. The consistent hum of the engine acts like a lullaby. They fall asleep because the ride is steady and the engine sound is constant.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think passengers feel so secure in your car?

**Speaker 2:**
It's a habit. I've been driving for many years, and I focus on maintaining a steady speed rather than driving fast. Most people ask if I use cruise control because the ride feels so smooth. For example, on routes like Lianyungang to Taiyuan, the road conditions are quite stable. I usually set the speed around 110-115 km/h, and it doesn't vary by more than 3 km/h. On the highway, this slight variation is hardly noticeable, so they think I'm using cruise control, but I'm not.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's talk about when you are a passenger. What driving behaviors make you uncomfortable, even if they are not necessarily unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
I dislike it when the speed fluctuates unpredictably. The most annoying thing is when the driver straddles the lane lines.

**Speaker 1:**
Straddling the lane lines?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you can't tell if they are going left or right. It's unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**
Even if they are within their lane?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it makes me uneasy, and it's hard to communicate this without offending them.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the best way to drive to ensure passenger comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to be considerate of their feelings. If you're driving with someone who doesn't know how to drive, they won't notice much. But if you're driving with someone who knows how to drive well, they will be more critical. For example, they might notice if you don't signal before turning. Sometimes, when they are in your car, they might glance around to relieve their visual fatigue.

**Speaker 1:**
After a while, they might look at something on the left side.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes they glance around to relieve their visual fatigue.

**Speaker 1:**
They might look at something in the distance or nearby to relax their eyes. On the highway, they might look at roadside landmarks to keep themselves alert. For instance, they might remember a specific sign or landmark they passed.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's a habit to look at something to relieve visual fatigue.
Speaker 1:
Sometimes, I like to use landmarks on the side of the road as reference points. For example, after passing a certain intersection, I might remember a specific building or sign. It's a habit, really, to use roadside structures to keep track of my location.

Speaker 2:
Given the conditions of our test area, we don't have many opportunities for overtaking. Can you recall your usual driving habits when overtaking other vehicles? It seems like our current road doesn't allow for overtaking.

Speaker 1:
Yes, this type of road doesn't really allow for overtaking.

Speaker 2:
But in general, what are your habits when you do overtake?

Speaker 1:
Actually, on the previous road, there was a van I wanted to overtake. I thought about it but decided against it to avoid affecting the test. Normally, if there's no oncoming traffic, I would accelerate and overtake, especially at a curve.

Speaker 2:
At the curve, right.

Speaker 1:
Yes, if you look back, you can see it. Just after turning onto this road, there was a brown van.

Speaker 2:
Do you mean further ahead?

Speaker 1:
No, just after turning onto this road. I wanted to overtake it, but it stopped.

Speaker 2:
I see.

Speaker 1:
When I saw there was no traffic ahead, I considered overtaking.

Speaker 2:
So, what are your usual habits when overtaking?

Speaker 1:
I prefer to be decisive. Either I don't overtake at all, or I keep a safe distance, or I accelerate quickly to pass. Especially on highways, I avoid lingering near large trucks.

Speaker 2:
But sometimes, we need to change lanes to check for oncoming traffic before overtaking. If there's a long stretch without oncoming traffic, we can safely overtake.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:
Sometimes, it can be hard to judge the distance of oncoming traffic, making it difficult to decide whether to overtake.

Speaker 1:
In such cases, it's important to signal your intention clearly. Move into the lane decisively, showing the car ahead that you intend to overtake. Don't inch out slowly; make a clear move.

Speaker 2:
But sometimes, the car in the left lane doesn't give you enough space to overtake.

Speaker 1:
In that case, it's better not to overtake.

Speaker 2:
There's not much you can do.

Speaker 1:
Yes, on roads like this, overtaking can be risky unless you have a clear opportunity.
**Speaker 1:**
When you're driving, you don't always need to overtake if the speed is manageable.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, sometimes there's no need.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. On roads like this, overtaking can be very risky unless you are certain the other driver will let you pass. If you see the oncoming vehicle slowing down and moving to the side, it usually means they are giving you space to overtake. If I were in front and saw the other driver doing this, I would slow down to let them pass. It's all about mutual understanding on the road.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's a common practice. Now, I have some other questions for you. You've been driving for over 30 years. What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 1:**
First and foremost, it's about your mindset. You can't be filled with anger when you're on the road. You need to stay calm and composed. 

**Speaker 2:**
Absolutely, staying calm is crucial.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. You can't let your emotions dictate your actions. Everyone on the road shares some responsibility. Even if an accident isn't your fault, you still need to be cautious and considerate. It's about mutual respect and not letting emotions control your driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, and what else besides mindset?

**Speaker 1:**
Besides mindset, it's about understanding basic driving skills and road psychology. For instance, children crossing the road will often run straight across without looking. They just want to get to the other side as quickly as possible.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they don't usually hesitate; they just run.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. They won't think about running back. On the other hand, older people might start crossing and then decide to turn back if they feel unsafe. You need to anticipate these behaviors.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you need to be prepared for them to step back.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you need to understand their behavior. If you see a child running, you should be ready to steer around them if you can't stop in time. Steering is often faster than braking in sudden situations.

**Speaker 2:**
If you can't stop in time, steering around them can be a safer option.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. Steering can help you avoid an accident when braking alone might not be enough. With older people, you should anticipate that they might turn back. Many traffic accidents happen because drivers don't anticipate these behaviors.
Speaker 1:
When you can't move the steering wheel, you just need to hold the brake. It's hard to turn the wheel. For elderly drivers, you need to be cautious because they might suddenly turn back. Many traffic accidents happen because of such situations. You need to be aware of these things.

Speaker 2:
Can you give some more examples?

Speaker 1:
When we were learning to drive, we were given a book about the psychology of pedestrians and drivers.

Speaker 2:
Do you remember the name of the book?

Speaker 1:
It was called "Psychology of Driving and Pedestrians." It discussed various aspects, like how many accidents happen on the road. For example, children often run straight into the road without thinking.

Speaker 2:
What do you think is the biggest difference between a new driver and an experienced driver like you?

Speaker 1:
It's often about mindset. Experienced drivers are not as nervous. New drivers might make mistakes because they are tense or overly cautious.

Speaker 2:
In terms of specific maneuvers?

Speaker 1:
Yes, the more stable your mindset, the fewer mistakes you make. If you're too nervous, you're more likely to make errors.

Speaker 2:
We're approaching another intersection. This one seems dangerous, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, it's a left turn.

Speaker 2:
I noticed you didn't pay much attention to the right side. Why is that?

Speaker 1:
I glanced at it earlier. From my experience, I knew that even if a car was coming fast, it wouldn't reach me in time. There was nothing to worry about.

Speaker 2:
So, you analyze the situation quickly?

Speaker 1:
Yes, even if a car is fast, it can't reach us before we safely cross the intersection.

Speaker 2:
Back to the earlier question, besides mindset, what other differences are there between new and experienced drivers?

Speaker 1:
Experience is another factor. Experienced drivers have driven on many roads and know how to handle different situations. New drivers might not have that experience and could make mistakes at intersections.

Speaker 2:
Like not yielding when they should?

Speaker 1:
Exactly. They might not think about the other driver. Many new drivers only think about whether they can go, not whether they should let the other driver go first.

Speaker 2:
Anything else?

Speaker 1:
A good mindset is crucial. I don't feel stressed while driving.

Speaker 2:
Have you heard about the new automated driving features? What do you think about them?

Speaker 1:
There are some things that automated driving can never do as well as a human driver.
Interviewer: With the continuous introduction of new frameworks and features, what aspects do you think autonomous vehicles will never be able to match human drivers or professional drivers? Are there areas where you believe they can never be fully replaced?

Speaker 1: Artificial intelligence is truly impressive. Recently, I've seen AI in action, and when you combine it with vehicles, it can handle many situations that humans might struggle with.

Interviewer: What are some things that humans can do but you think AI cannot?

Speaker 1: It seems like there's nothing AI can't do. It learns and remembers everything, unlike humans who tend to forget. AI can even find shortcuts quickly, something that might take us months to learn. AI doesn't get tired; it can drive 24 hours straight at a constant speed of 120 km/h without any drop in performance. Humans, on the other hand, get tired and need rest. Our physical capabilities vary, and we age and fatigue.

Interviewer: For manual transmission, you still need to...

Speaker 1: Yes, you still need to manually shift gears and use the clutch.

Interviewer: Using the clutch is a significant part of driving.

Speaker 1: I always feel that driving a manual car is a bit better than an automatic. Why? Because it keeps you more engaged.

Interviewer: It gives you more control.

Speaker 1: Yes, it keeps you active and less likely to get drowsy. On highways, driving an automatic can make you sleepy because it's just constant driving.

Interviewer: Do you think autonomous vehicles can completely replace human drivers in the future?

Speaker 1: If combined with AI, I think they can.

Interviewer: Completely?

Speaker 1: Yes, because AI can predict human behavior. It can analyze a person's gait and predict their actions, something we can't do.

Interviewer: So, it can anticipate what people will do next.

Speaker 1: Yes, it can foresee and calculate actions.

Interviewer: But do you think it lacks the professional experience that humans have, especially in critical situations like dealing with children or elderly pedestrians?

Speaker 1: It can learn that too.

Interviewer: And elderly people?

Speaker 1: You give it the information, and it learns and never forgets. If you give it 100 rules, it remembers all 100. Humans might forget 60 of them and only remember 40. So, it can consistently recall all the rules.

Interviewer: So, you believe that autonomous vehicles can judge the intentions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles just like humans do?

Speaker 1: Yes, I believe with autonomous driving, traffic congestion in cities could be solved because AI follows rules strictly.
Speaker 1:
I feel that with autonomous driving, city traffic congestion issues could be resolved because it follows rules and doesn't overtake recklessly.

Speaker 2:
What about safety?

Speaker 1:
Safety is better than ours. Most accidents are caused by people not following traffic rules. If you use artificial intelligence to drive cars, I believe the number of accidents would significantly decrease.

Speaker 2:
Another point we've been discussing today is the passenger experience. Do you think autonomous vehicles can cater to this experience? Many passengers have reported that autonomous vehicles don't drive like humans; they brake and accelerate abruptly, trying to reach their set destination as quickly as possible.

Speaker 1:
That's just in the early stages. As autonomous driving technology advances, it will become more intuitive. For example, at an intersection, it will decide whether to go or not based on predictive analysis. It might start adjusting its speed 100-200 meters in advance because it has foresight. Unlike humans who rely on their eyes, autonomous vehicles can use satellite data to understand road conditions ahead. So, I believe that combining artificial intelligence with autonomous driving will be very effective.

Speaker 2:
As a driver, how do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles? Motor vehicles are relatively easier to predict because they use turn signals and horns. You can see them moving towards your lane if they intend to change lanes. Drivers can also communicate with each other using headlights. But pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles are harder to predict. How do you usually judge their intentions?

Speaker 1:
In the city, I tend to yield more to pedestrians. Many drivers don't; they push forward if they can. But I believe in yielding more to avoid accidents.

Speaker 2:
So, you prioritize yielding to others?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I believe in yielding. If you rush, you won't get there any faster. Even if you bump into someone, it won't speed things up. It's better to be cautious and avoid accidents. We drivers are vulnerable on the road.

Speaker 2:
I understand. Let me describe a scenario. Often, when crossing the street, whether on foot or driving, I encounter situations without traffic signals. Both pedestrians and cars need to cross, but pedestrians are unsure if the cars will yield to them. How do you handle such situations?
**Speaker 1:**
When there's no traffic signal and both pedestrians and cars need to cross the road, it can be confusing. The pedestrian might want to cross but isn't sure if you'll let them. Similarly, as a driver, you don't know if the pedestrian will move forward or wait for you to pass. How do you judge the pedestrian's intentions in such scenarios, especially when there's no clear indication?

**Speaker 2:**
It's not about letting one person go; sometimes you have to let a whole group pass. If they're already there, you have to let them go.

**Speaker 1:**
But if we want to be efficient and get through quickly, what strategy would you suggest? You can't always let the car sit there waiting because once people know you'll always wait, they'll ignore traffic signals and just cross whenever they want.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, at such intersections, it can be endless.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if there's a large crowd, how do you decide if a person wants to cross or not?

**Speaker 2:**
If someone is determined to cross, I'll stop and wave them through, signaling them to go first.

**Speaker 1:**
But sometimes people start crossing and then stop in the middle of the road.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they might block your car.

**Speaker 1:**
If they block your car, you have to consider if they're trying to cause trouble.

**Speaker 2:**
Not necessarily. They might be assessing the time and distance between you and them. They might take a few steps, stop in the middle, and then decide they can't make it and step back.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, especially older people. Younger ones might just run across, but older ones might retreat. In such cases, you should signal them to go first. Have you ever driven on rural roads where the streets are crowded with people?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, rural roads can be very crowded, with vendors on both sides selling all sorts of things. It can be hard to find a clear path.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, and sometimes you have to drive through the middle, which can be dangerous for pedestrians and other vehicles. When the road is crowded, you have to be very careful.

**Speaker 2:**
In such situations, you might need to use your horn to alert people.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, but not excessively.
Speaker 1:
When you were coming back, the road was congested. You only have one route to take, so what do you do? Back then, we often communicated this at the big market.

Speaker 2:
You have to honk the horn, right?

Speaker 1:
No, no, even if you honk, you can't get through. You have to inch forward bit by bit.

Speaker 2:
So, you inch forward bit by bit. What if someone says something?

Speaker 1:
Yes, you inch forward. As long as the front of your car moves forward, the road will eventually clear up.

Speaker 2:
What if you stop?

Speaker 1:
If you stop, you'll never get through. There are people in front of you. After going through this a couple of times, you'll get used to it. It's always crowded.

Speaker 2:
This is a proactive issue. You can't really see it.

Speaker 1:
Yes, small cars come through.

Speaker 2:
Right, you have to be here to see the innermost lane. You can't see the outer lane from a distance. At this point, you think your car's front is in, and they can see you.

Speaker 1:
Yes, but I still have to watch them. I let them go without slowing down.

Speaker 2:
I actually get quite scared in such situations when they are very close to my side.

Speaker 1:
You haven't merged into their lane yet.

Speaker 2:
It's like temporarily turning into a lane without fully merging into the rightmost lane.

Speaker 1:
I don't know, isn't this a bus lane? So, I try not to use it.

Speaker 2:
Oh, you think this is a bus lane?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I try not to use it. Especially at that place called Zizhouyuan, where turning into the bus lane will get you a ticket immediately. So, I avoid the bus lane.

Speaker 2:
Do you have anything else to do later? If not, we can chat more because I think your insights are valuable. If you have something to do, we can skip the panoramic camera and just finish this discussion.

Speaker 1:
We can chat a bit more, no problem. I feel like we get along well.

Speaker 2:
So, when you were making a U-turn during the test drive, you waited for the left turn light to turn green, then you moved into the left turn lane before making the U-turn. I'm not quite sure, if I want to make a U-turn directly to the store, what light should I look at?

Speaker 1:
If there's a left turn arrow, you wait for it. If there's no arrow, you can make the U-turn when it's clear. When the left turn arrow is on, you wait for the oncoming left turn traffic to clear before making your turn.
Speaker 1:
He allowed the straight traffic to go first. What do you mean? Didn't you see there was a left-turning car on the other side? After I entered, I let the left-turning car pass, and then he immediately let the oncoming traffic go. When I tried to turn left, it affected the oncoming traffic. So, I had to wait for the left-turn arrow to light up. This situation was unavoidable, and it even affected the right-turning traffic on the other side. Did you notice there was a bus on the opposite side? It was turning right while I was trying to turn left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the light duration was a bit long. At that moment, it was straight and left-turn traffic. Then, we continued.

Speaker 1:
When you want to turn left, you have to wait for the oncoming traffic. You can't just turn whenever you want.

Speaker 2:
The oncoming traffic was going straight.

Speaker 1:
Now, we can only wait for the arrow light.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I understand. So, either during the red light or when the left-turn arrow is on.

Speaker 1:
During the red light, did you directly adjust? If there wasn't such a situation...

Speaker 2:
If you were the first one, you could directly turn. But in Liuzhou, you can't just enter like that.

Speaker 1:
Yes, you have to keep a distance.

Speaker 2:
I understand.

Speaker 1:
At the beginning, we couldn't enter from the main road. If you turn from the main road, you can't make it into the side road. Look, at this moment, there's a bus turning right. You have to let it go first. This is entering the side road.

Speaker 2:
Alright, our video might be ending soon because we have some other things to do. But there were a few questions that I found interesting. You seem to know a lot about autonomous driving. You mentioned that autonomous driving can predict the intentions of pedestrians, motor vehicles, and non-motor vehicles. How do you think autonomous cars can become more human-like?

Speaker 1:
Because they follow strict programming. Sometimes, when we want to turn right, we might not look carefully, or an electric bike might be too fast or too slow. Human perception is limited. If an electric bike is parallel to your car, it's in your blind spot, and you can't see it. But with artificial intelligence, it has multiple "eyes."

Speaker 2:
So, if we treat autonomous driving as a set of data, it's like teaching me to drive. If I want to drive like you, what should I focus on?

Speaker 1:
First, your mindset. Stay relaxed. Driving isn't difficult.

Speaker 2:
Autonomous cars don't have this problem; they are always relaxed.

Speaker 1:
Yes, they never get nervous.

Speaker 2:
Besides...
Speaker 2:
Autonomous cars don't have this issue; they don't get nervous.

Speaker 1:
Right, they are always relaxed and never get anxious.

Speaker 2:
Besides the mindset, what else is there?

Speaker 1:
Well, there are some routines, like in the military. You know, checking left and right, signaling, and so on.

Speaker 2:
For example, after you take control, which side do you check first?

Speaker 1:
Exactly. When you start the car, there's a procedure. You develop a habit of checking your surroundings—left, right—before moving. Over time, it becomes second nature. You look left, look right, and if everything is clear, you proceed. Another important thing is to keep your eyes on the distance, not just right in front of you. Many new drivers get nervous and only focus on what's immediately ahead, which makes them even more anxious. They need to lift their heads and look far ahead, occasionally glancing to the sides.

Speaker 2:
So, I understand that new drivers tend to focus on keeping their car straight by looking at the front of the car.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, but that actually makes it harder for them to drive straight.

Speaker 2:
And they might focus on the lines on the road, checking if their car is aligned, but they neglect to look further ahead or use their mirrors to check the sides. Experienced drivers, on the other hand, keep their vehicle stable and straight effortlessly by focusing more on the distance and their surroundings.

Speaker 1:
When you look far ahead, you become more relaxed and less anxious. If you only focus on what's close, any sudden obstacle will make you panic. I once taught a driver who only looked at the road right in front of him. He was so nervous and didn't know what to do. I told him to look 200 meters ahead, and he immediately felt less anxious. When he focused on the distance, he wasn't overwhelmed by the close-up details.

Speaker 2:
Got it. Let's move on to another topic. Are there any particular driving scenarios that left a strong impression on you? Maybe we can discuss those specific situations and the road conditions, as you might not have been able to see everything from the driver's seat. Are there any complex or dangerous road conditions that you think are worth reviewing?

Speaker 1:
Yes, there are a few intersections without proper signage.

Speaker 2:
Intersections?

Speaker 1:
Yes, where cars enter without clear signals.

Speaker 2:
And what about the situations you mentioned earlier with the supervisor?
Speaker 2: At the intersection, this entrance actually...

Speaker 1: There was a car entering, um...

Speaker 2: And then, as mentioned earlier, the director and, um, they blocked your position.

Speaker 2: Then it directly switched to our reporting platform.

Speaker 1: Now, intentionally or unintentionally, I glanced at the right side mirror, right.

Speaker 2: The car's front was already moving to the right.

Speaker 1: I should have moved closer.

Speaker 2: To the bottom right. At this point, we saw that the right wheel had definitely crossed the line, but it was on the other side of the line.

Speaker 2: Then I turned the wheel and immediately let go. For this kind of control, I might not have dared to do it; I would have reversed. I couldn't judge the position of the car's front well, the key...

Speaker 1: Is fearing the car behind getting too close.

Speaker 2: How do you judge the distance between the right front of the car and the curb?

Speaker 1: Actually, the first time I turned, I almost brushed the leaves, but I didn't want to take that risk, understood.

Speaker 2: Then the second time, you felt...

Speaker 1: Definitely, the second time I got closer, I could definitely make it.

Speaker 2: We reached that right turn, right. At that right turn, you couldn't see the telecom public account, right? Actually, it also gave way. At this point, you could see it letting you pass. So you didn't need to worry about it.

Speaker 2: Then you made the right turn. There were no cars coming from the left at various entrances. At the fourth entrance, there was no congestion, as I mentioned earlier. If it were me, I wouldn't have seen it because I thought if he wanted to park, he should move forward. Right.

Speaker 1: He shouldn't park within 30 meters.

Speaker 2: Right, he stopped there.

Speaker 1: Then I turned, and...

Speaker 2: I asked you, not knowing what he wanted to do. If you want to park, move to the front of the parking area and give me space.

Speaker 1: There were also cars coming from the opposite direction, all sorts of situations.

Speaker 2: The most important thing is the perspective. From various directions, it didn't feel much different. Do you understand? Today's road conditions were also relatively good. This is it, regardless, we saw it here and moved on.

Speaker 2: When turning, there was a problem I might have forgotten to ask you. This intersection is very small. In our previous experiments, we often missed this intersection.

Speaker 1: Yes, it looks similar to the one in front.

Speaker 2: The one in front also has a similar structure, or drivers often don't realize it. How did you judge it?

Speaker 1: I didn't follow you.

Speaker 2: I...

Speaker 1: I recorded it early on, basically.

Speaker 2: Right?

Speaker 1: I had already referenced it. I was looking for landmarks, I kept an eye on the road.
Speaker 2:
Right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I referred to it earlier. When I look at my target, I'm looking for the right lane. I keep an eye on the road, noting any unique features at each intersection. The first time, I felt that this intersection was very close to the next one, and I wondered if I might take the wrong turn. There was a bus ahead. Once I passed the bus stop, I knew I was on the right track, so I remembered that bus stop.

Speaker 2:
Then I returned to the road.

Speaker 2:
At this point, it's actually quite difficult to judge the number of vehicles coming from this direction. One reason is the distance, and the second is the presence of non-motorized vehicles. They slow down because they are a bit scared, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Next lesson. Yes, at this point, you use this.

Speaker 1:
Yes, the speed of the cars over there is quite fast.

Speaker 2:
They actually slow down.

Speaker 1:
First, they are afraid of me, and second, they are afraid of the car behind me.

Speaker 2:
Even if the car behind you can't wait for you to come out.

Speaker 1:
Yes, they panic.

Speaker 2:
This is actually the road condition here.

Speaker 1:
Yes, if you can see it, if there is a display.

Speaker 2:
You can't see it on the display.

Speaker 1:
Yes, if there is this, you can see the value comprehensively. The safety system would be much higher.

Speaker 2:
That's about it.

Speaker 2:
Do you have any interesting experiences or influences during your driving that you would like to share with us? If not, we might conclude today's interview as it has been quite long already.

Speaker 1:
I think what you're doing is quite good. Gathering experiences from hundreds of drivers.

Speaker 2:
Yes, we actually want to compare the habits of experienced drivers with those of new drivers.

Speaker 1:
It's mainly about mindset. When you're waiting at a red light and the car in front doesn't move, the car behind honks. I say, even if you honk, it won't fly over the car in front. Why honk? It wastes electricity and creates noise. If you're in front of a hospital and you honk, you could get fined. There's no need for that.

Speaker 2:
Are you interested in seeing the data from the passenger side? Passengers have a device in their hands.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I want to understand their mindset and income.

Speaker 2:
They will look at it. Let's take a look. I haven't seen this data either.

Speaker 1:
When you pass an intersection, sometimes they feel uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
It's not well divided.

Speaker 2:
It's not just the A column. The neighbors also have the A column. Why isn't it divided? It's only in the A column. Do you know how to divide it? I have some impression, but I need to check the comprehensive symbols and charts.
Speaker 1: Hey, do you know how to split the data in column A? I have a vague idea, but I need to use a delimiter. Should it be a comma? It seems like it’s not splitting correctly. But look, when you select column A, do you see these people? How should I select them?

Speaker 2: Start by importing the data with the delimiter set to a comma. That should work. Yes, that should be fine. Let's take a look. First, we filter out all the zeros, so we only see the instances where the handle was actually moved.

Speaker 1: But isn't that a small number?

Speaker 2: Yes, there aren't many instances within one second. We can look at the specific data points, like this one at 4.04.

Speaker 1: 4.02, so around two minutes in, this should be the test scenario, right? Let's check the later part. I think we can start by looking at this segment. We should look at the video from 03:03, which is after 05:00. So, we have 05:00 and 10:00 as the key points.

Speaker 2: Yes, let's look at the two-minute video segments. At 05:00, it might be that the passenger stayed in the car for too long. Around 8 minutes in, we can see. And at 10:00, is it after the U-turn? From 7 minutes to 9 minutes, it should be within the 10-minute mark. The passengers might have felt uncomfortable after the U-turn.

Speaker 1: The car started moving, and the speed increased.

Speaker 2: Yes, and it could also be that the passengers felt uncomfortable during the turn, especially with non-motorized vehicles suddenly appearing. After that, there isn't much. We can see that another passenger didn't feel any difference.

Speaker 1: Can we differentiate between the front and back seats?

Speaker 2: No, we can't tell who was in the front or back.

Speaker 1: I suspect it was the back seat. The passenger in the back might have felt uncomfortable due to the centrifugal force during the turn. Women generally don't like the swaying motion as much as men do.

Speaker 2: Okay, let's combine the feedback. The passengers' feedback is gradually coming in. If you want to know the evaluation from the review, I can talk to the person responsible for the interview.

Speaker 1: No need, it's fine.

Speaker 2: If you need anything else...
Interviewer: I understand that part of the review is about your driving experience. I can discuss this with the person responsible for the interview.

Driver: No need, it's fine. 

Interviewer: If you don't mind, then there's no need.

Driver: I was driving.

Interviewer: Yes, most of the time. Actually, during the test drive, I felt quite sleepy while sitting in the car.

Driver: Especially on long trips, you start talking and then suddenly there's no sound.

Interviewer: Thank you very much.

Driver: You're welcome.

Interviewer: If you have any other questions or need our assistance, feel free to contact me. Okay, and then about the materials...

Driver: This has been removed, right?

Interviewer: Yes, and there's a popular model. I also have it printed out.

Interviewer: Next time, we might be a bit unsure and nervous, but it should be the same. I'll give you a copy with the questions. It feels like... yes, the latest version. I have a pen in my bag. If you can fill it out now, you can give it to me. If you need to check something, you can take it home and send it to me later, or send it via WeChat after checking.

Interviewer: You might need to fill it out on the computer. I know that 123456 is already filled in. If you remember everything, you can fill it in now.

Interviewer: Numbers, right? Account, yes. Do you need anything else for the meeting? Okay, then I'll end our meeting here.
