**Transcript:**

**Interviewer:**
In a moment, we will be able to see the footage from the camera mounted on the car's roof. It was recorded from an external perspective. Originally, there was supposed to be footage from the glasses you were wearing, but there was a slight issue with them, so we don't have that. We might need your help to recall where you were looking and how you were operating the vehicle at that time. Before we went downstairs for the experiment, we had already discussed several questions with you. Could you help us by recalling your actions and observations during the drive?

**Driver:**
Yes, the two images don't seem to show much in front of the car. Even with the camera on the roof, it still focuses on the front. It started raining suddenly, which made us a bit nervous. We were mainly concerned about handling any special situations safely. When we returned safely, I can show you the video. It provides a 360-degree view around the car, offering a broader perspective than the driver's view. This feature is quite useful. 

**Interviewer:**
Do you usually drive short distances for daily tasks? What kind of driving do you typically do?

**Driver:**
Yes, I usually drive around 10 kilometers round trip, mostly within the Haidian District. 

**Interviewer:**
I see. So, you mentioned that you have some experience with automatic evaluations. Do you find the current level of automation to be not very reliable or responsive? Are there any features you prefer to use because they are more practical and intelligent?

**Driver:**
Yes, I find the ESP (Electronic Stability Program) quite useful. It prevents the wheels from locking up. However, some features, like the automatic braking system, can be a bit intrusive. I prefer to have control over certain aspects of driving, especially in complex traffic situations.
**Speaker 1:**
Could you help our matchmaker in the industry? He mentioned that it's an entry point. So, you turn on the static mode, use economic means, and then open the new mode. What do you see people doing? In the Tesla, when you turn on the autopilot, what happens?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, or when you drive and approach a red light, the Tesla will automatically stop.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, and when you pass by, the green light might come on, and the car will proceed. The system prioritizes these actions. Do you feel scared?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not scared. When I see someone doing these things, it's like they are not aware of the world around them. I drive while they leisurely drink tea. It's an ideal scenario for many people.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, maybe in a few years, this will be a reality. But currently, there are issues, especially with braking. Sometimes, it's unclear whether the problem is with the driver or the car. There are many possibilities. If the car doesn't change lanes when you want it to, it can be frustrating.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and when you want to change lanes, the car might not respond as expected. It can be a bug.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. Overall, how do you feel about driving the vehicle? Is it comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, generally comfortable. However, in rainy weather, the camera might get a bit blurry, which can affect visibility.

**Speaker 1:**
By the way, have you ever had the experience of picking up important passengers? I think you mentioned it before.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, even within the company, picking up important guests is a regular task.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you determine the importance of a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Every passenger is important to me. But for more significant events, like meetings in March or May, the level of importance increases.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, I see. So, for higher-level events, you might have more responsibilities.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have handled such tasks before.

**Speaker 1:**
So, for slightly more important tasks, you might be assigned to them.
Speaker 1:
So, for example, if there are some slightly more important tasks, like picking someone up, you would pay more attention to the overall experience, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If I'm driving alone, it might be different. But if I have passengers, especially important ones, I would take extra care. I would make additional efforts. I wanted to ask you, what specific things do you pay attention to? What are some of the actions you take?

Speaker 1:
Sure, give me a moment to check something.

Speaker 1:
Can you say something again? Hello, hello? No, it should be fine. Can you say something again? Hello? Yes, okay, there was a bit of a transfer issue earlier. Let's continue. Alright, let's start from here. How is the overall traffic today? Are there a lot of cars? Is it very congested? Because I heard from the experimenter in the car that it feels quite congested.

Speaker 2:
Yes, there's a school in that area.

Speaker 1:
Are you dropping off kids? 

Speaker 2:
Yes, but the weather is extremely hot today, and the side mirrors are almost impossible to see through.

Speaker 1:
So, you rely on the right rear window and the right side window to see?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I have to turn my head significantly to check the angles. I do use the side mirrors, but they can't be my main reference.

Speaker 1:
So, this is the first turn on the entire route, excluding the departure scenario. What are your usual driving habits when making such turns? Do you have a routine, like checking one side before the other? Or do you have a specific speed you maintain? How do you pay attention to pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
In Beijing, you are required to yield to all pedestrians. You need to stop and let them pass. Generally, if I'm making a right turn, I first look to the left because that's where the oncoming traffic is. The right side is where you are turning into, so you need to be cautious.

Speaker 1:
So, for a right turn, you first look to the left?

Speaker 2:
Yes, whether it's a right or left turn, you need to check the direction of oncoming traffic first. This is crucial.

Speaker 1:
And the other vehicles have the right of way.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you need to check the left side first, whether it's pedestrians, cars, or non-motorized vehicles.
Speaker 1:
And the other person was also driving straight.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the first thing you do is look to the left, whether it's a pedestrian, a car, or a motor vehicle. At this point, you should be ready to stop at any moment. Your car should be moving very slowly, and your foot should be on the brake, ready to stop at any time. If there are no obstacles, you can proceed.

Speaker 1:
Yes, proceed slowly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, proceed slowly. If you see that the traffic light is about to change and there are no pedestrians or cars, you can accelerate a bit to make the turn. If there are cars and pedestrians, you should maintain a slow speed and be ready to brake at any moment.

Speaker 1:
And on the right side, as you mentioned, you can't see everything in the rearview mirror. When you turn right, there could be non-motorized vehicles, pedestrians, or bicycles.

Speaker 2:
That's why you should first look to the left. If you don't, a car could come from that direction at high speed.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:
Whether it's a bicycle, car, or electric scooter.

Speaker 1:
Or a motorcycle.

Speaker 2:
Vehicles coming from the left can be very fast. After checking the left, quickly glance to the right. Since vehicles on the right might be going against traffic, you should prioritize the left.

Speaker 1:
So, vehicles coming from the opposite direction, right? For example, if a non-motorized vehicle is coming from the right, you need to be aware of it.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when we turn right at this intersection.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. My point is that an electric scooter could be in your blind spot.

Speaker 2:
Yes, before making the turn, you should check the left side. Once you've checked the left, you can proceed.

Speaker 1:
If there are no cars on the left, you can move forward, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, keep your foot on the brake, check the left, then quickly glance to the right. Also, keep an eye on the rearview mirror. If it's raining lightly, you can still see through the windshield. When the rain gets heavier, the wipers will be on continuously.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. At that point, it might be hard to see what's on your right side.

Speaker 2:
What you can see or can't see doesn't matter much. If a vehicle is about to hit you from the side, there's not much you can do. You can't just accelerate to avoid it.

Speaker 1:
So, there's not much you can do in that situation.
Speaker 1:
What measures did you take? You couldn't do much because he was about to hit you, right? Accelerating quickly wouldn't have been realistic.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, I couldn't do much to avoid it. I just tried to stay as close to the left line as possible.

Speaker 1:
So, you couldn't make any extra effort to dodge it. You just stayed close to the left line as much as you could.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was already as close as I could get. When visibility is poor, you try to leave enough space for pedestrians, cyclists, and other non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 1:
Got it.

Speaker 2:
We always keep an eye out, but sometimes it's not a conscious effort; it becomes a habit. No one wants an accident, whether the weather is good or bad. Accidents and fights are always troublesome.

Speaker 1:
It seems like the traffic is quite heavy.

Speaker 2:
It's not too bad. We waited for two traffic lights back there, and one here.

Speaker 1:
Did you wait long to make a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
No, the U-turn wasn't too long. It was just at the corner, near the bottom right of that intersection.

Speaker 1:
So, you saw the oncoming non-motorized vehicle from a distance, right? There was an electric bike; did you see it? You saw it from far away, right? Because I noticed you started steering to the right early on. Initially, you were close to the left line, but then you clearly started moving right to avoid it. You were supposed to enter the main road, so you shouldn't have been steering right.

Speaker 2:
I was trying to give way.

Speaker 1:
To the bike?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was trying to give way. According to the new traffic regulations, if you hit him, it wouldn't be entirely your fault. But regardless of responsibility, it's about humanity.

Speaker 1:
So, you tried to avoid it if you could.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because no one wants an accident. Even if it's not your fault, seeing someone injured is distressing. We're all human, right?

Speaker 1:
This is a crucial point because you were about to enter the main road. Can you explain your usual practice or habit when merging from a side road to a main road? Or just this time, how did you handle it? In our previous experiments, we noticed that the greenery here significantly obstructs your view. You can't see the oncoming traffic clearly. Today, there weren't many cars.

Speaker 2:
Yes, today the traffic was light.

Speaker 1:
But even if you were here, the rearview mirror wouldn't show you what's coming from behind. You have to move forward to see.

Speaker 2:
Exactly.

Speaker 1:
Only then can you get a better view of the road. So, I'm curious about your process when driving in such situations.

Speaker 2:
Well, as you mentioned...
**Speaker 1:**
So, I’m curious about your driving experience. What was the process like when you were driving?

**Speaker 2:**
You mentioned that the greenery obstructed your view. It’s not like you can’t see anything at all; it’s not a high wall. The first thing you should always do is slow down and signal. You need to signal in advance. If there are cars outside, they will be visible through the gaps in the greenery. Remember, in our city, the dividers in the urban area won’t completely block your view of the main or side roads.

**Speaker 1:**
So, there are some gaps you can see through, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you can see through them. Generally, I start signaling about 70 to 90 meters before the turn and slow down as I approach the intersection. Even if you can’t see clearly, you should slow down and keep your foot on the brake, ready to stop. If you can’t see through the mirrors, you might need to turn your head to get a better view. If that doesn’t work, adjust your angle to ensure safety.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you ensure safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Safety is the top priority. Today, we didn’t encounter many issues. It was quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Maybe it was around 4 PM, and those who needed to leave had already left, and those who didn’t were still at work.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, many people leave around noon when their kids finish school.

**Speaker 1:**
What was your speed at that time? I couldn’t see it clearly.

**Speaker 2:**
It was around 30 km/h.

**Speaker 1:**
I felt it was even less, maybe 20 to 30 km/h.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because there were cars ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Right.

**Speaker 2:**
You just follow the flow. If you speed up, you’ll have to brake suddenly.

**Speaker 1:**
And?

**Speaker 2:**
The road was slippery because of the rain.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the traffic jam long?

**Speaker 2:**
It lasted a few minutes, maybe three or four.

**Speaker 1:**
I felt it was longer, especially near the school.

**Speaker 2:**
It took about seven minutes from the start. When I got there, I couldn’t see the line.

**Speaker 1:**
Which line are you referring to?

**Speaker 2:**
The line near the traffic light where you make a U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
The line ahead? It’s okay, we can take our time. This was our first test drive.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the first test drive.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you manage to make the turn on the first try?

**Speaker 2:**
It doesn’t matter if you make it on the first try. What’s important is that during the test drive, the visibility was good, and everyone made the U-turn from there, even though it’s not allowed.
Speaker 1:
Where we were going wasn't important. What was important? When we first started the test drive, the visibility was good. Everyone was making U-turns here, but it's not allowed. Right here.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's a solid line, but they were all crossing it.

Speaker 1:
The U-turn should be made at the dashed line up ahead.

Speaker 2:
Yes, at the dashed line. Because the yellow and white lines are there for U-turns. Later, when I continued the test drive, I couldn't see the lines clearly. It made me a bit uncertain because if it's a solid line, U-turns are not allowed at a red light, right? So, I felt a bit unsure, especially with many cars behind me trying to make a U-turn.

Speaker 1:
So, some people might not be able to make the turn, like that windmill car. Right.

Speaker 2:
I understand. In Beijing, the driving experience is that as long as there are no cameras, people drive however they want. That's basically the situation.

Speaker 1:
Okay. What is your usual habit when making a U-turn? Because, to be honest, when you make a U-turn, your speed is relatively low. According to the rules, you have to yield to all other vehicles.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's right.

Speaker 1:
How do you handle it to make the U-turn quickly and avoid causing traffic congestion? What do you pay attention to? We can go back and review it if needed.

Speaker 2:
In normal weather and visibility conditions...

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when the light is red or green. If you can make a U-turn here, with no obstructions, no oncoming cars, and no pedestrians, you should speed up as much as safely possible.

Speaker 1:
Right. We've observed that some drivers might wait a bit before making a U-turn. They might adjust their angle slightly to the right to create more space for the turn. They might drive close to the right line before making the U-turn.

Speaker 2:
With more driving experience, people generally don't do that. I try not to cross the right line because if a camera catches you, you'll get a ticket. But if you move a bit to the right, you create more space on the left for a wider turn.

Speaker 1:
Yes, giving you a larger turning angle.

Speaker 2:
Yes, making it easier to make the turn in one go.

Speaker 1:
But you mentioned you couldn't judge the position of the dashed line clearly at that time.

Speaker 2:
I remember there was a dashed line.
Speaker 1: So, you had to make a sharp turn, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1: But you mentioned that you couldn't clearly judge the position of the dashed lines at that moment, correct?

Speaker 2: I remember there were dashed lines.

Speaker 1: You couldn't see the ground through the left rearview mirror, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, because it was raining, and there were water droplets on the car windows and the mirror. It was very blurry. If someone suddenly appeared from the side, it would be hard to see them clearly. I felt a bit unsure, so I decided to move forward a bit. I remember there were dashed lines, right?

Speaker 1: Was the car honking at you or someone else?

Speaker 2: I don't think it was honking at me. It felt like it was still a bit far away.

Speaker 1: If we had left 10 minutes earlier, maybe nothing would have happened.

Speaker 2: Yes, if we had left 10 minutes earlier, we might have avoided the heavy rain.

Speaker 1: And there was a right turn ahead. I noticed you were originally in the right lane and then moved towards the left lane. Is that correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, there was a puddle on the side of the road.

Speaker 1: I see.

Speaker 2: There were also many pedestrians.

Speaker 1: Got it. So, you were trying to avoid the water. Even if you were driving at 20 mph, you would still get splashed.

Speaker 2: Yes, I was trying to avoid the water as much as possible. Otherwise, I wouldn't have driven so close to the curb. It was a special situation today.

Speaker 1: Of course, you have to ensure safety. If there were cars passing by, you couldn't just take their lane.

Speaker 2: Yes, you have to slow down and be as cautious as possible.

Speaker 1: On a normal day without rain, how do you usually drive in the city? What speed do you maintain, and how do you manage the distance between cars?

Speaker 2: It depends on the speed limit of each road.

Speaker 1: Do you prefer to drive at the speed limit or slightly below it?

Speaker 2: I usually drive slightly below the speed limit if the road conditions allow it.

Speaker 1: If the road conditions are good, do you stick to the speed limit?

Speaker 2: If the road is clear, like at 2 or 3 AM when there's no traffic, and the speed limit is 60 mph, I would drive around 55 to 59 mph. The speed limits are generally reasonable, but I try to stay within that range.
Speaker 1:
I might have been driving at 60, usually around 57 or 58, between 55 and 59. I try to stick to that range because speed limits can sometimes be unreasonable, but most of the time, they are designed fairly well, especially in Beijing.

Speaker 2:
Yes, sometimes it's like that.

Speaker 1:
There are stretches where the limit is 80, and then suddenly it drops to 40, and then back to 80.

Speaker 2:
That's not really about being reasonable or not. Those cameras aren't always active; they're installed to meet certain requirements and change the speed limits accordingly.

Speaker 1:
What kind of distance do you usually keep from the car in front of you? Can you break it down by different speeds? For example, if you're driving at 40 km/h, what distance do you maintain?

Speaker 2:
At 40 km/h, generally...

Speaker 1:
Sixty to seventy meters?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I prefer to keep a safe distance.

Speaker 1:
Sixty to seventy meters seems a bit much, doesn't it?

Speaker 2:
Are you saying it's too wide or too long? It depends on the situation.

Speaker 1:
In the city, at 40 km/h, it's not really possible.

Speaker 2:
It depends on the traffic conditions. During rush hour, it's not feasible to keep such a distance.

Speaker 1:
Right, right, everyone is moving together.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if the traffic is flowing smoothly at 40 km/h, you can maintain a distance. But on different types of roads, like ring roads, it's different. On a ring road, maintaining 60 to 70 meters is fine. But if there are traffic lights every 300 meters, you can't keep that distance. When the light turns green, the car in front moves, and you need to keep a braking distance that allows you to stop safely. On the second or third ring roads, or on your way to work without traffic lights, everyone can drive at 40 km/h. In such cases, I keep a distance of at least 50 meters. Often, cars will cut in front of me, but as long as they don't block me, it's fine. If they do, I just let them go.

Speaker 1:
Here, you need to make a right turn. Can you see that there are no cars on this lane?

Speaker 2:
Yes, today we're lucky. Usually, there are many non-motorized vehicles here.

Speaker 1:
Yes, but today, because of the rain, visibility is poor, but there are fewer pedestrians.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the rain affects visibility, but there are fewer people out.

Speaker 1:
You can't see much from here, but you can look through the car window.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you should check your side mirror.

Speaker 1:
The side mirror doesn't show everything clearly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and the rearview mirror...
Speaker 1: At that moment, you should check your side mirror. 

Speaker 2: Yes, but you can't see much detail in the mirror.

Speaker 1: You can never see everything, only a part of it.

Speaker 2: Right, so at this point...

Speaker 1: You have to, even if it's from the rear side...

Speaker 2: Yes, you should try to accelerate and turn safely. I remember during the last lap...

Speaker 1: You changed lanes to overtake a car, right? That's quite rare. We don't often see drivers willing to change lanes during tests.

Speaker 2: Yes, because you mentioned earlier that I could do it. If the weather was better, I might have overtaken more cars. Today, the conditions weren't ideal.

Speaker 1: No problem. Can I ask, when you change lanes to overtake, what are your driving habits?

Speaker 2: Usually, I signal, but sometimes I don't because it's too much effort. If everyone is driving normally, theoretically, I should signal to let others know.

Speaker 1: Did you signal today? I couldn't see clearly.

Speaker 2: Not always. Sometimes I signal, sometimes I don't. It depends on visibility.

Speaker 1: No problem. How do you judge if the other driver will let you overtake? 

Speaker 2: Whether they start moving or not doesn't matter to me once I've changed lanes. We're not on the same lane anymore.

Speaker 1: From a distance, I saw their car's front end pointing left. Were they trying to move into the left lane or enter a neighborhood?

Speaker 2: They didn't signal.

Speaker 1: But they didn't signal.

Speaker 2: Right, for example, I would...

Speaker 1: Did you think they were going to turn?

Speaker 2: Possibly.

Speaker 1: So how did you judge it was safe to overtake?

Speaker 2: I felt it was relatively safe because the car wasn't moving fast. It was either stopped or moving very slowly.

Speaker 1: And you saw the car in front of you had already overtaken it.

Speaker 2: Yes, the car in front had overtaken it, so I felt it was safe. When I passed by, I thought they were going to park.
**Speaker 1:**
The car in front has already overtaken, and it seems like they were testing the road. When I passed by them later, I thought they were going to park, but they just kept going.

**Speaker 2:**
Were they trying to park here?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, they were either looking for a parking spot or doing something else. They were moving very slowly. I could have easily overtaken them because my speed was much faster. If it was safe to overtake, I would have done so. But as I was about to overtake, they suddenly turned left, and I almost crashed into them. In that case, they would have been 100% at fault.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because they changed lanes without signaling and didn't yield.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, they changed lanes without signaling, which is very dangerous.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was a forced lane change without using the turn signal.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what is your usual habit when overtaking on the highway? As a new driver, I find overtaking quite scary, especially when there are large trucks. People often say you should quickly overtake them and not stay behind them.

**Speaker 2:**
If you are following a large truck, keep a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, either overtake them quickly or keep a safe distance.

**Speaker 2:**
Don't follow them too closely.

**Speaker 1:**
I feel scared when overtaking large trucks because they block my view.

**Speaker 2:**
When overtaking, make sure you have a clear view ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
I've observed that some drivers first move to the left lane, the overtaking lane, and sometimes flash their high beams to signal their intention to overtake. This happens both during the day and at night. They stay in the overtaking lane for a while to make sure the car in front knows they want to overtake. Then they accelerate and overtake.

**Speaker 2:**
My habit is quite similar. I usually move my car slightly to the left to get a better view of the lane I want to overtake in. This also makes the driver in front aware of my intention to overtake. Always use the turn signal on the highway to alert the car in front. When you are ready to overtake, increase your speed and make sure the lane is clear, especially if there are large trucks.
Speaker 1:
"Attention to the vehicle ahead, I'm going to overtake now. When you're preparing to overtake, you need to speed up. While doing so, you must pay attention to the vehicle in front of you, especially if it's a large vehicle."

Speaker 2:
"Large vehicles are wider and may straddle the lane lines. You need to watch the distance between their wheels and the lane lines. If they start moving closer to the lane line, you should be cautious. If they keep moving towards the line, you might get squeezed. At this point, you need to decide whether to continue overtaking. You might need to brake and abandon the overtaking maneuver, even if you've already signaled."

Speaker 1:
"If the vehicle ahead doesn't notice your signal, it might mean the driver is drowsy or distracted."

Speaker 2:
"If the vehicle is swaying and not maintaining a stable path, it might not be safe to overtake. Ideally, the driver should move slightly to the right to let you pass."

Speaker 1:
"If the driver sees you and moves to the right, you might feel it's safe to overtake. But you should still be cautious and keep an eye on the vehicle's position relative to yours. If it suddenly moves back towards you, you should reconsider overtaking. On the highway, you can never be 100% sure of safety, but you should aim for at least 99.9% certainty. Whether you're driving alone or with passengers, safety should always be the top priority."

Speaker 1:
"Let's pause the video for now and continue when we reach the entrance. In this experiment, we've been emphasizing safety. What specific safety measures do you focus on while driving?"

Speaker 2:
"First, I always buckle my seatbelt and remind my passengers to do the same. Once, I had a foreign passenger who I thought hadn't buckled up, so I checked twice to make sure. I told him, 'Safety first.' Also, always drive within the speed limit. Whether you're a new driver or experienced, always adhere to speed limits, whether on highways or in city areas. I've been driving for nearly 30 years, and my experience has taught me that following the rules is crucial. Some rules are visible, but others are learned through experience."
Speaker 1:
Because, you see, I've been driving for almost 30 years, and my experience tells me that there are rules you can see and rules you can't see. As long as you drive within the safe speed limit, your safety rate will be very high.

Speaker 2:
I understand. Even if there's an accident, it won't be serious if you're within that speed range.

Speaker 1:
Exactly. But if you speed, then it can become a big issue.

Speaker 2:
Yes, speeding makes it very easy to encounter problems. People shouldn't think that driving at 120 km/h on the highway is too slow and push it to 150 or 160 km/h. That can be very dangerous.

Speaker 1:
Right, it directly affects the car's safety and the driver's control.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the car can become unstable at high speeds. I’ve never dared to drive that fast.

Speaker 1:
Some cars become unstable, while others don't.

Speaker 2:
Some cars feel more stable the faster they go, with a heavier steering wheel.

Speaker 1:
But generally, the faster you go, the less stable the car becomes. Think about it, is it easier to control the steering at 30 mph or 300 mph?

Speaker 2:
Exactly, at high speeds, even a slight movement can make the car veer off.

Speaker 1:
The fastest I've driven was 200 or 220 km/h. At that speed, the dashed lines on the highway become a blur.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they become a continuous line, like a flowing river.

Speaker 1:
Why did you choose to drive over the dashed line and then turn back?

Speaker 2:
Was this on the Fourth Ring Road?

Speaker 1:
No, it was an internal road, not the Fourth Ring Road.

Speaker 2:
So, it wasn't at an intersection yet?

Speaker 1:
Not quite, just a bit before. It was okay, we just slightly crossed the line.

Speaker 2:
I probably thought it was fine and just turned.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it was just a little bit, and there were no cars or people around. How do you usually approach such intersections?

Speaker 2:
First, I check the rearview mirror before turning.

Speaker 1:
When you turn, you first look at the cars coming from the side, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at an intersection like this, the first reaction is to check the right rear side.

Speaker 1:
Right, you need to check the right side first.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when you're about to turn right, you quickly glance around to see all the entry points. During the turn, you must constantly check the right rearview mirror.
Speaker 1:
Just a quick glance, and you can see everything, just these few entrances. Then, while you're turning, you must always check your right rearview mirror. At this moment, you must look at the right rearview mirror. Because if an electric bike comes from behind, it can be very fast. When you first see it, it might be 30 meters away, but since you're turning slowly, it can suddenly zoom past you.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it can cut in front of you.

Speaker 1:
Especially those food delivery guys, they are really fast nowadays.

Speaker 2:
On this road, there shouldn't be much else. Can I ask about your usual driving experience? What situations do you find most frightening?

Speaker 1:
Frightening?

Speaker 2:
Yes, what situations make you feel uneasy?

Speaker 1:
Bad weather, not exactly frightening, but I don't like it.

Speaker 2:
You don't like driving in the rain, sandstorms, or foggy conditions?

Speaker 1:
Such weather doesn't bother me much if I'm driving my own car or a car I'm familiar with.

Speaker 2:
At that time, it wasn't too bad. I feel it gets worse in the latter part of the journey.

Speaker 1:
Are there any tips for keeping the side mirrors clear of water? If you really can't see, you can lower the window and raise it again to clear the water a bit, improving your visibility.

Speaker 2:
Yes, lowering and raising the window can help clear the water.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, it brushes off the water a bit.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but the worst is winter when it snows.

Speaker 1:
And the car is warm inside while it's cold outside.

Speaker 2:
The fogging isn't a big deal.

Speaker 1:
It's not a problem, right? Just turn on the car's air conditioning.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you can use the air conditioning to clear the fog. But driving in such weather can be quite dangerous. If you're driving in the city, it's manageable. But if you're on hilly or mountainous roads, it can be very dangerous. Your car might slide even without pressing the gas pedal. How do you drive in such conditions? I particularly dislike those roads. Also, in summer, I've encountered heavy rainstorms.

Speaker 1:
The kind where you can barely see anything?

Speaker 2:
Yes, on July 21st, I was out driving all night. I was in Wangjing and almost got stuck. I was with my boss, and I didn't have much experience back then. Everyone was parked there, but the road conditions were actually not good. The water had already flooded the area, making it impassable.

Speaker 1:
The water had already risen, making it impossible to pass.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the water level was quite high.
Speaker 1:
The road conditions were actually pretty good, but there was water, and it was flooded, so you couldn't pass.

Speaker 2:
The water was at least this deep from the ground. When I was driving, I didn't dare to accelerate or decelerate. You could see the water level from the car window.

Speaker 1:
Exactly. If you let go of the gas, you might not be able to press it again.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was really nervous at that moment. It was truly nerve-wracking.

Speaker 1:
So, the water had already covered the exhaust pipe.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it had. If you have that kind of situation, you can only hope for the best. If the engine gets damaged, there's nothing you can do. What were you most afraid of at that time?

Speaker 2:
I was afraid because, after heavy rain, many manhole covers get lifted. 

Speaker 1:
Would the car get stuck?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if the water is deep enough, the tires could get stuck. 

Speaker 1:
If the tires get stuck, the car is done for. The car might be ruined, but at least the people inside wouldn't be submerged. If you have experience, you know how to handle such situations. I saw others do experiments where they got stuck in traffic ahead.

Speaker 1:
Oh, near the school?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at the turn.

Speaker 1:
Did you notice the school during the test drive?

Speaker 2:
No, I didn't. When we passed by, school wasn't out yet, so it was easy to drive. I didn't expect the traffic jam to be because of the school.

Speaker 1:
Besides bad weather, what other situations make you nervous?

Speaker 1:
Even in normal weather, there can be situations caused by pedestrians, other vehicles, or other reasons that make you anxious. Do you recall any such situations?

Speaker 2:
I'm not afraid of heavy traffic or crowds because I live in a tourist area. I'm used to driving slowly in such conditions. As long as you're not in a hurry, it's fine. What I fear most is driving in the summer heat, especially around noon or in the afternoon when it's easy to get drowsy. Sometimes you have no choice but to drive, and I'm afraid of dozing off. Other than that, there's nothing much that scares me. Most experienced drivers have encountered various situations, so there's not much to worry about.
**Speaker 1:**
So, with all your years of driving experience, what situation has scared you the most?

**Speaker 2:**
The scariest moment was when I was driving a large truck on a mountain road. This road passed through a village that was under construction, with buildings on both sides of the road.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there animals like cows or sheep crossing the road?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it wasn't animals. It was children. The road through the village was downhill, and I couldn't stop the truck easily.

**Speaker 1:**
You couldn't brake?

**Speaker 2:**
At that time, I had only been driving for about a year, so I didn't have much experience or reflexes. The village had many alleys on both sides of the road, and you couldn't see if someone was coming out. I remember it very clearly. I wasn't driving fast, maybe around 30 miles per hour, coasting to save fuel. My foot was lightly on the brake, and as I approached an alley, a child suddenly rode out on a bicycle.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you steer the wheel?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't have time to steer. I had been driving for about a year, so I had some reflexes. Instinctively, I slammed on the brakes. There was no time to think about steering. In that instant, I broke out in a cold sweat. The child on the bike passed right in front of my truck.

**Speaker 1:**
Wow.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the child passed right in front of the truck. I was so scared that my foot was shaking on the brake pedal. It took me a minute or two to calm down and lift my foot. That was really frightening. This happened when I had just learned to drive, about a year in. Even now, 20 years later, I still encounter a few scary moments every year.
Speaker 1:
So, you just learned to drive about a year ago, right? It's been over 20 years now, and you must have encountered some scary situations at least once or twice a year when you first started. But none of those incidents were so significant that they left a lasting impression on you, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Those situations are often referred to as "ghost pedestrians." They suddenly appear out of nowhere, catching you off guard.

Speaker 1:
I understand. "Ghost pedestrians" are those who suddenly appear from behind a vehicle, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's right.

Speaker 1:
For example, if there's a large vehicle, like a bus, and someone suddenly darts out from in front of it.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. I had a friend who used to play with us when we were kids. He was about five or six years younger than me. His wife was hit by a car in such a "ghost pedestrian" incident.

Speaker 1:
Oh no.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it happened while my friend was standing on the other side of the road.

Speaker 1:
He saw it happen?

Speaker 2:
Yes, she probably saw her husband and rushed across the road to meet him.

Speaker 1:
She ran across the road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, she got off the bus and saw her husband waiting on the other side. I heard about it from others later; I couldn't ask him directly. They said she was hit because she was rushing to meet him. This incident left a deep impression on me about "ghost pedestrians."

Speaker 1:
I see. When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what driving habits make you feel nervous?

Speaker 2:
Not braking in time.

Speaker 1:
Not braking in time? So, you feel like they should brake, but they don't?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because the perception of distance is different when you're driving versus when you're a passenger.

Speaker 1:
The perception of distance is different?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when you're driving, your foot is always ready on the brake, and you're prepared to stop at any moment. But as a passenger, you might feel like the driver should be braking sooner.

Speaker 1:
So, from the driver's perspective, it might seem fine, but as a passenger, it feels different?

Speaker 2:
Yes, sometimes it's fine, but other times it really is the driver's fault. Everyone has different driving habits. Some drivers like to save their brake pads and only brake when absolutely necessary. I prefer to start braking early and gently.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Do you have any bad driving habits yourself?

Speaker 2:
Sometimes when I'm driving...

Speaker 1:
Besides feeling sleepy?

Speaker 2:
Yes, sometimes I smoke while driving.

Speaker 1:
You smoke while driving?

Speaker 2:
Not always, but sometimes.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you ever feel sleepy while driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes. Besides feeling sleepy, I occasionally smoke.

**Speaker 1:**
You smoke while driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Not always, but sometimes. It's not a good habit. Nowadays, with Beijing's strict traffic laws, you can't really afford to have bad habits.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand.

**Speaker 2:**
You also can't afford to take risks.

**Speaker 1:**
Are we stuck in traffic here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we are. We just passed the school. Now we are heading south.

**Speaker 1:**
No, we are heading west.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, right. This is the Water Drop area, isn't it?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it is.

**Speaker 2:**
We've been stuck here for a long time.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems so. How long have we been here?

**Speaker 2:**
Not too long.

**Speaker 1:**
This traffic is really bad.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we've been here for quite a while.

**Speaker 1:**
During today's drive, did you encounter any dangerous situations? Even slightly dangerous ones?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel any danger.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually pay attention to the passengers' experience while driving? I assume you do since you are a professional driver.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. Often, the passengers are my boss, family, children, or guests. To make them comfortable, I focus on safety and smooth driving. Sound is also important.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you use headphones?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I always carry both wired and wireless headphones. Sometimes the battery runs out, and I need to switch. Even if the boss doesn't require it, it's a matter of mutual respect. They don't need to know the route details; they just want a comfortable ride.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides safety, what else do you do to ensure their comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
The difference between driving your own car and being a professional driver is significant. Comfort comes from several aspects: ride comfort and visual comfort.
**Speaker 1:** What's the difference between driving your own car and having a professional driver? Let's talk about comfort from a few aspects. First, there's the comfort of the ride itself, and second, the visual comfort.

**Speaker 2:** Right, the comfort of the ride is partly due to the car itself.

**Speaker 1:** Is that about the car's features?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** And the second aspect is visual comfort?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, visual comfort refers to how clean the car looks. For example, you might wash your own car every two weeks. 

**Speaker 1:** Oh, I see.

**Speaker 2:** It's about whether the car looks clean on the outside and inside. Even if there's a bit of dust because you haven't washed the car for a few days, you can keep a cloth handy to wipe it down regularly. This helps maintain a clean interior, which contributes to the overall comfort of the ride. Also, avoid eating strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, or leeks in the car. Coffee is usually fine because most people don't mind its smell. But if you like eating strong-smelling foods, remember that other passengers might not appreciate it.

**Speaker 1:** So, regarding the car's interior environment, when driving, I want my passengers to feel like they're not even in a car. Almost as if they're relaxing on their couch at home. How can I achieve that?

**Speaker 2:** By driving smoothly. 

**Speaker 1:** Exactly. I think the most comfortable driving experience is when it feels like you're not even in a car, allowing passengers to fall asleep easily. That would be an excellent experience.

**Speaker 2:** Have you noticed that when you're not actively trying to sleep, the gentle, consistent motion of the car can actually help you fall asleep? 

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I understand what you mean.

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes, you might find it hard to sleep in a friend's Mercedes or Audi, but on a long bus ride, you might fall asleep easily because of the consistent engine noise and motion.

**Speaker 1:** Right, especially if the engine is at the back.

**Speaker 2:** No matter where you sit, on a long bus ride, you might fall asleep quickly.

**Speaker 1:** Got it.

**Speaker 2:** So, it's about the noise, the smell, and the cleanliness of the car.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, but sometimes when I take a ride-hailing service or a taxi...
Speaker 1:
Hmm, it's about several aspects.

Speaker 1:
Yes, for example, when I take a Didi or a taxi, I often feel very uncomfortable with the way they drive. I get extremely nervous and keep staring out the window, always feeling like they're about to crash into the car in front. Even if they might still be at a safe distance, it makes me uneasy. Especially with many electric cars nowadays, their sudden starts and stops make me feel really dizzy and uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
But haven't you noticed that...

Speaker 1:
Why is that? Is it a habit issue, or is it that they don't deliberately control the vehicle? Many new drivers also tend to brake very hard, causing a sudden stop that throws you forward due to inertia.

Speaker 2:
There are actually many factors at play here. First, have you noticed that car prices have dropped significantly compared to a few years ago? Drivers don't really care about the passenger's comfort. Unless it's a high-end car...

Speaker 1:
Yes, unless it's a good car.

Speaker 2:
Right, unless it's a high-end car.

Speaker 1:
Nowadays, with A-class and B-class cars, they don't care about these things.

Speaker 2:
It's not just about the car class; it also depends on the driver. Many drivers have different driving habits. With lower car prices, you might feel like you've spent a decent amount, say 50 or 80 yuan, but the driver might only get 45 yuan for a 30-kilometer trip. They feel like they're not making much money, so they are conflicted. They don't want to cancel the ride because they need the money, but they also want to finish quickly to pick up the next passenger. Especially during peak hours, they are in a hurry to complete the trip and move on to the next one. Many platforms have requirements for the number of trips completed, offering rewards for reaching certain targets. For example, if you complete 10 trips, you get a reward, and then they might push you to complete 12 trips for another reward. They are constantly chasing time and speed, especially before certain deadlines like 8 AM or 10 AM. In such situations, they prioritize speed over comfort. However, if you spend more money on a premium service, you naturally get better comfort.

Speaker 1:
So, taking a premium car service...
Interviewer: What kind of comfort are we talking about? In this situation, it's all about the mindset, right? But if you spend more money, the comfort naturally comes. You see?

Interviewee: Yes, like when you book a premium ride.

Interviewer: You mean like Didi Premier?

Interviewee: Yes, Didi Premier or Didi Express. At least with the Premier service, the driver, whether they like it or not, has to open the door for you, or ask if you need an umbrella when it's raining. They have certain protocols to follow, whether they are genuine or not. At least they ask.

Interviewer: They have to meet certain standards.

Interviewee: Exactly. They might offer you water, for instance. This is the Premier service. If you have a bigger budget, like for company travel expenses, you can book a luxury ride. Then you get an S-class car, and the driver might be in a suit, treating you like a VIP.

Interviewee: In the car, you might find various snacks and drinks neatly arranged. The driver will be extremely polite, without any impatience. They might ask if the air conditioning is comfortable for you, or if you want to listen to music. If the service is really good, they might even ask what kind of music you prefer. This makes you feel very comfortable. You might even feel compelled to give a generous tip. But for the same route, a Didi Express might cost 10 yuan, a Didi Premier 22 yuan, and a Didi Luxury 108 yuan, right?

Interviewer: Yes, so what do you think makes a good or professional driver? What should they do?

Interviewee: I think everyone has a different understanding, but safety is always the top priority.

Interviewer: So, the first thing is to ensure safety.

Interviewee: Yes, I believe that if you can ensure safety, you are already doing well.

Interviewer: But I think safety should be the minimum requirement. It's the basic value you provide.

Interviewee: True, but even this minimum requirement is not always met by every driver.

Interviewer: Right. So, besides safety, because we want to call them good or professional drivers, what else should they do?

Interviewee: Besides safety, they should ensure social harmony. While driving, they should not only focus on their own safety but also not affect others. Roads are public, and everyone has the right to use them. You can't just ensure your own safety and make others wait behind you. That would be affecting others, right?

Interviewer: So, there was a traffic jam for a long time, right?

Interviewee: Yes, it was jammed for about ten minutes earlier.
Speaker 1: So, you were stuck in traffic for a while, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, we were stuck for about ten minutes. We got here, and it was around seventeen minutes in total.

Speaker 1: Still stuck here?

Speaker 2: Yes, it seems like we've been here for quite a while. We were stuck for about three minutes before we could move. This is where we need to make a left turn, right? After this, there shouldn't be any more issues. But when we got onto the Fourth Ring Road, it was congested again. I was a bit nervous because I wasn't sure if I was recording.

Speaker 1: In situations like this, when someone blocks your lane, how do you feel?

Speaker 2: He was either stopped or moving very slowly. I remember he was stopped. Drivers like him, if they encounter someone with a bad temper driving a bulldozer, they might get bumped. It's just a lack of courtesy. You shouldn't park or drive like that.

Speaker 1: I understand. Do you feel scared when you see someone with their hazard lights on?

Speaker 2: There's nothing to be scared of. Just keep your distance. If you encounter someone with their hazard lights on or any uncertain situation, remember to stay far and slow down.

Speaker 1: Right.

Speaker 2: I saw a yellow bike covered with a garbage bag or a raincoat. It looked like a garbage bag. After that, there were no more issues until we reached the Fourth Ring Road. When I was about to make a right turn, I couldn't see the lane clearly. I thought the lane next to me was a bike lane, but the navigation showed two lanes. The right lane was for right turns.

Speaker 1: And then?

Speaker 2: I was in the left lane, and I thought I should be in the right lane for the turn. There was no bike lane. I kept thinking about it, and then two cars passed by. 

Speaker 1: So, the right lane was clear?

Speaker 2: Yes, the right lane wasn't a bike lane. The navigation showed two lanes for right turns. When I moved forward, I realized there were two lanes ahead. You can check it out later; I recorded a bit of it. There was no bike lane.

Speaker 1: This entrance is crucial for our experiment because it wasn't marked correctly.

Speaker 2: On my way back, it was still congested.

Speaker 1: Yes, I wanted to ask if the unmarked situation made it more complicated. There was no clear indication of who should go first.
Speaker 2:
When I was coming back, it was still congested here.

Speaker 1:
Right. I wanted to ask, in situations without traffic lights, it gets more complicated, right? There's no clear rule on who goes first. So, how do you usually observe and handle such situations?

Speaker 2:
First of all...

Speaker 1:
Today, you mentioned it was good that there were no non-motorized vehicles. Usually, at this time, there are pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles, and without traffic lights, it's very difficult to navigate.

Speaker 2:
Yes, first of all, you need to ensure that as you move your car forward, the space in front of you is clear of pedestrians and other vehicles. You need to make sure it's safe to proceed. If others don't yield...

Speaker 1:
You mean if they don't yield...

Speaker 2:
Yes, if you're making a right turn and your car is already halfway through the turn, they should yield to you.

Speaker 1:
But sometimes they don't yield.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if you notice that they are not yielding and are driving very fast, you should wait and let them pass. For example, if you're going straight through a green light and you see a car running a red light, you have to let them go to avoid a collision.

Speaker 1:
This is the place you mentioned earlier.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Look at the traffic volume here.

Speaker 1:
No, no, this is definitely problematic. This is not a proper lane for motor vehicles.

Speaker 2:
At first, I didn't pay attention. I thought it was a normal lane for motor vehicles and non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 1:
Right, right. And then you saw them passing by.

Speaker 2:
Yes, a couple of cars passed by, and I didn't notice at first. Then I got stuck in traffic.

Speaker 1:
For a while?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and I saw there were about 100 meters left. I wasn't sure if you could see it on the map.

Speaker 1:
It's okay, we can check it.

Speaker 2:
No, I mean, at that time...

Speaker 1:
You mean the navigation?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the navigation showed two lanes for motor vehicles, with the right lane for right turns. I thought I should follow the left lane for straight or left turns.

Speaker 1:
Another car passed by.

Speaker 2:
Yes.
Speaker 1: It was about 100 meters away, and my navigation showed two lanes for motor vehicles, with the right lane for turning right. I said I would follow the left-turn lane.

Speaker 2: Another car passed by.

Speaker 1: Yes, another car passed by. I was confused. If it wasn't raining, I might have had better visibility. I decided to go ahead, and as I moved forward, I realized that the basic lane split into two. You see the red dot on the board, right?

Speaker 2: Does it split into two lanes here?

Speaker 1: Yes, I thought the non-motorized lane was for turning right. Initially, I didn't understand it correctly and started queuing up.

Speaker 2: You started queuing up.

Speaker 1: Then several cars passed by, making me lose confidence. I thought, "Okay, I shouldn't follow the straight lane; I'll turn right."

Speaker 2: When merging into the main road with a right turn, how did you observe the situation?

Speaker 1: First, I looked to the left.

Speaker 2: Yes, you don't need to look at the red light here.

Speaker 1: Right, there were no electric bikes or tricycles because they don't follow the rules strictly. I checked the right rearview mirror, and there were no cars behind. So, I proceeded cautiously. If someone was coming from the front, I would let them pass if they were far enough. But if it was a pregnant woman or someone with a child, I would give them enough time to cross.

Speaker 2: You don't need to stop because you might have enough time to pass, but you don't know the situation behind you.

Speaker 1: Exactly, you don't know what's happening with the cars behind you. You might end up blocking them.

Speaker 2: Yes, you might end up blocking them. So, you need to be careful in such situations.

Speaker 1: Right. After that, I went back. The intersection was a bit congested for two or three minutes.

Speaker 2: Yes, it was congested again when I turned left. There were no traffic lights, and the rest of the journey was smooth.

Speaker 1: What do you think is the biggest difference between professional or experienced drivers and new drivers?

Speaker 2: The difference? Yes, the gap.

Speaker 1: In terms of ability, skill, and driving level, where is the biggest gap? Or, in summary, what is the biggest difference?

Speaker 2: Actually, there's not much difference because experienced drivers were once new drivers too. It's just that...
Speaker 1:
What do you think is the biggest difference or the main takeaway between new and experienced drivers?

Speaker 2:
Honestly, there's not much difference because every experienced driver was once a beginner. It's just that...

Speaker 1:
I noticed you mentioned that you had only been driving for a year at the time and didn't have much experience. But you also talked about having some reflexes. You seem to emphasize the importance of reflexes a lot.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because reflexes are an instinctive reaction. When you don't have time to think, you rely on your reflexes.

Speaker 1:
So, when you don't have time to react, you depend on your reflexes, right?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Your brain doesn't even process it, but your body already knows what to do. It's like the difference between someone who's been doing a job for a week versus someone who's been doing it for ten years. The level of proficiency is completely different, right?

Speaker 1:
Do you think reflexes are the biggest difference between new and experienced drivers?

Speaker 2:
I don't think there's a huge difference.

Speaker 1:
Because everyone has some level of reflexes, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, unless it's your first day driving, then you probably don't have any. But...

Speaker 1:
On the first day, everything is new, and you might react to everything.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, but in a real emergency, a new driver might panic and freeze. When you're driving, it's just a steering wheel, an accelerator, and a brake. Nowadays, there's not even a clutch.

Speaker 1:
Right.

Speaker 2:
In the past, you had to coordinate with the clutch.

Speaker 1:
Now you don't need to worry about that.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, it's much simpler now.

Speaker 1:
The car won't stall.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it won't stall. Modern cars handle it automatically.

Speaker 1:
So, what happened at that intersection?

Speaker 2:
It was a bit of a mess because there were no traffic lights, and everyone was trying to get through. It was raining, so everyone was cautious and slow. But once you get your car's nose ahead, others usually let you through. However, if two cars are trying to merge into the same lane, it can get tricky. Ideally, it should be one car from each side taking turns.

Speaker 1:
So, one car from each side takes turns?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but sometimes when you let one car through, the cars behind it all try to follow.

Speaker 1:
And then you end up stuck.
Speaker 1:
Sometimes, when you let the car in front of you go, all the cars behind it will follow.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they will all try to go through, and then you can't get through. This happens because the cars behind don't follow the rules. They don't understand. But if you notice, many taxi drivers, when they don't have urgent business, will let you go. If someone lets you go, you should let someone else go. It's mutual because everyone is driving.

Speaker 1:
Ah, and then there are non-motorized vehicles. Yes, this intersection is quite complicated. It's just one lane, right? One lane for going straight, turning left, and turning right, isn't it?

Speaker 2:
Look at that small green car; it's not being reasonable. I wanted to go, but it had to push through, so I had to go around it. If people see you let two cars go, they will let you go next. If it's not bad weather, on a normal day, you should signal and greet the other driver. Most drivers, not 100%, but 99%, will understand. No matter how busy they are, if you raise your hand or say, "Sorry," their anger will dissipate quickly.

Speaker 2:
I don't know if you've experienced this, but during rush hour, when you want to merge into a lane, if you signal, the cars behind won't let you in. But if you lower your window and signal with your hand, almost all drivers will let you in. If someone doesn't let you in, they might have an urgent matter. But generally, people understand if you signal that you're in a hurry.

Speaker 1:
You mean sticking your hand out the window?

Speaker 2:
Yes, extend your hand a bit so they can see you want to merge. This also works in places without cameras or at intersections with police. If a police officer sees you crossing a line, you can signal to them, and they usually won't bother you.

Speaker 1:
Is this more common in Beijing, or do other cities have this too? It seems to me that it happens more in Beijing compared to other places.

Speaker 2:
I haven't driven much in other cities, but I've been to places like Zhengzhou and Taiyuan. I've been to Daqing in the northeast, but I think it's similar everywhere. As long as you signal with your hand, people across China have the same temperament. If you don't compete, they won't either. If you lower your window and say, "Sorry, brother," it usually works.
Speaker 1:
Not much difference. If you just hire a second-hand driver, actually, all Chinese people have this temperament. Don't argue. If you argue, they'll be more stubborn than you. If you're tough, just roll down the window and say, "Hey, brother, sorry, but you shouldn't have cut in. What do you think?"

Speaker 1:
Up ahead, there's a car driving dangerously. Can you see that black car? It overtook the gray car and came from there.

Speaker 2:
It came from the right, didn't it?

Speaker 1:
Do you have something urgent? If not, I can speed up here.

Speaker 2:
A little bit. I need to get back soon.

Speaker 1:
So, you think the difference between new and experienced drivers isn't that big?

Speaker 2:
Generally, the gap between an average new driver and an average experienced driver isn't that large. New drivers tend to drive fast, while experienced drivers usually drive slower. It's rare to see a driver with 20 years of experience immediately hitting 120 km/h or 140-150 km/h on the highway. They usually cruise at around 80-100 km/h.

Speaker 1:
The next few questions might be a bit difficult. In what aspects do you think autonomous vehicles can never match human drivers? Where do you think they will always fall short compared to real drivers?

Speaker 2:
Real-time road condition judgment?

Speaker 1:
Yes, real-time road condition judgment.

Speaker 2:
It's impossible. Just like a robot, you can only program it to a certain extent. You can't anticipate every road condition.

Speaker 1:
In some situations, it might not know what to do and just stop there. It could crash.

Speaker 2:
Someone once said that many cars boast about features like autonomous driving and automatic parking. Many women, before buying a car, tell their husbands, "Hey, this car is great; it can park itself." But remember, if you find a parking spot difficult, the car will too. Don't think, "Oh, our parking spot is narrow, let the car park itself." If you find it hard, the car's computer will too. It can only mimic humans; it can't surpass them. After all, it was made by humans, right?

Speaker 1:
So, you think real-time road condition analysis is where it falls short. Are there any areas where you think it can outperform humans?

Speaker 2:
Are you talking about electronic assistance features?

Speaker 1:
For example, if there's already an autonomous vehicle that doesn't require any human control and can drive itself.

Speaker 2:
Yes, like shared bikes sometimes. You see them there...
Driving a vehicle that doesn't require human control and can drive itself.

Speaker 2:
Nowadays, there are also shared bicycles. Sometimes you see them around.

Speaker 1:
Yes, like in Yizhuang, for example.

Speaker 2:
I've seen them around Guomao, moving like a van.

Speaker 1:
Right. Do you think it's possible for them to drive like humans, or even better?

Speaker 2:
Well, they should definitely follow traffic rules strictly. They are programmed to adhere to the traffic regulations you input.

Speaker 1:
Do you think this strict adherence to traffic rules is good or not?

Speaker 2:
Of course, it's good.

Speaker 1:
But sometimes it can be rigid. For example, if a passenger is standing here and the vehicle can't change lanes due to traffic rules, it might just leave without picking up the passenger.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it might happen. If there's no barrier in the middle and it's a solid line, it won't change lanes to pick you up.

Speaker 1:
For instance, if someone is standing by the roadside, the vehicle won't change lanes to pick them up.

Speaker 2:
The most frustrating thing is if there's no barrier or camera, a human driver might just make a U-turn.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, they might cross a solid line to make a U-turn.

Speaker 2:
But the autonomous vehicle won't do that. It will drive a couple of kilometers to find a proper place to turn around.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it might take one or two kilometers to make a U-turn, and if there's traffic, it could take even longer.

Speaker 2:
Right, it could be stuck in traffic for half an hour. In such cases, what would you do?

Speaker 1:
Would you wait or not?

Speaker 2:
The vehicle's approach is correct, but waiting 40 minutes for a U-turn is impractical. Humans can be more flexible.

Speaker 1:
Humans might bend the rules a bit to save time or for convenience.

Speaker 2:
Minor errors can be understandable and harmless.

Speaker 1:
Exactly.

Speaker 2:
If there's no camera or barrier, and there's a nearby intersection, a small deviation might be acceptable.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and other cars while driving?

Speaker 2:
That comes with experience.

Speaker 1:
Yes, for example, motor vehicles are easier to predict because they have signals. Even if they don't signal, you can often tell their intentions by their wheel movements.
Speaker 1:
Because cars have lights, they signal when they are about to turn or move. Even if they haven't turned on the signal, you can often tell from the direction of the wheels where the car is going. But the hardest to predict are pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles. For example, if someone is standing by the roadside, I can't tell if they are about to cross the street or just standing there playing with their phone.

Speaker 2:
Yes, everyone has different standards for judgment.

Speaker 1:
Exactly. And with non-motorized vehicles, they can suddenly swerve. You don't have enough time to react. So, I really want to ask you, how do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving?

Speaker 2:
Are you asking about judging their intentions or avoiding accidents? Judging their intentions comes down to experience. Whether it's a child or an experienced driver, everyone relies on their own experience. A driver with three years of experience has three years of experience, and a driver with 30 years has 30 years of experience. Even a child riding a bicycle has their own life experience to draw from. Everyone's experiences are different, but it all boils down to relying on one's own experience.

Speaker 1:
So, based on your experience, in what kind of situation would you predict someone's behavior? For example, in a scenario without traffic lights, if a pedestrian wants to cross the street and you are driving straight, how do you decide whether to let them go or to go first?

Speaker 2:
If I'm already on the road and the pedestrian is standing there, I will go first because my car is already in motion, and I might not have enough time to stop. However, if I see the pedestrian and I have enough time, I will let them go first, regardless of whether they intend to cross or not.

Speaker 1:
So, you always let them go first?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I slow down, sometimes it happens that both of us hesitate, trying to let the other go. In such cases, I will signal them to go first.

Speaker 1:
Got it.

Speaker 2:
It's always better to let the pedestrian go first. But if I'm already at the intersection and they are just approaching, I will go first. If they continue to rush, I will accelerate and go through.

Speaker 1:
What if they keep rushing?

Speaker 2:
Then I will speed up and go through first.
**Speaker 1:**
You were rushing towards the intersection. If you want to go first, go ahead, but I’m going first. What if...

**Speaker 2:**
What if he keeps rushing?

**Speaker 1:**
If he does, then I’ll accelerate and go first. That’s the only way because my car is already at the intersection. If he continues, I can only assume he’s willing to risk his life and sees me as his fateful encounter. Sorry, but I can’t accept that. I need to go first. In such a situation, you see my car is already here, and you’re still rushing forward? That’s clearly your problem, right? No normal person would do that, would they?

**Speaker 2:**
But sometimes it happens. For example, if there are many people crossing the street, and you let one person go, then the whole crowd will follow. You have to wait until everyone has crossed.

**Speaker 1:**
You wait until it’s safe to proceed. That’s what the traffic laws say now. You can’t inch forward to provoke them.

**Speaker 2:**
If there are many people, you should stop completely, put the car in park or neutral, and keep the brake on. Just wait patiently, no matter how much the people behind you honk. If they’re in a hurry, they can go first.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it.

**Speaker 2:**
I see many of your questions are about feeling anxious or angry while driving. The longer you drive, the less you’ll feel that way. Getting angry doesn’t help; the car won’t move faster, and you’ll only stress yourself out.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, because we’re trying to solve a problem. If all cars are self-driving in the future, pedestrians or other drivers will know that you won’t dare to hit them. They’ll always expect you to yield.

**Speaker 2:**
It’s a tricky issue, isn’t it? They think you won’t dare to hit them.

**Speaker 1:**
In the future, self-driving cars can’t always be expected to yield forever.

**Speaker 2:**
Traffic signals are necessary.

**Speaker 1:**
What if there are no traffic signals?

**Speaker 2:**
Then the car must yield because it’s the weaker party.

**Speaker 1:**
It must yield, but not unconditionally or without limits.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, it’s not about conditions or limits; it’s about principles. You must yield. Let’s say we’re at an intersection...

**Speaker 1:**
No problem, I’ll let them go. Can we turn around at the next intersection?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, at this intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, this intersection.
Speaker 1:
No problem, I just wanted him to let me pass. Do you think we can make a U-turn at the next intersection? Is it possible?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at this intersection.

Speaker 1:
Alright, this intersection it is.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, this one. Pause for a moment. If there are pedestrians on either side, even if there's just one person crossing, you must wait and stop. Does this road have traffic lights?

Speaker 1:
Yes, it does.

Speaker 2:
It doesn't matter if the light is red or green.

Speaker 1:
According to traffic rules, yes. For example, I might yield to pedestrians, but if the light is green, I should proceed, and pedestrians should wait. However, with autonomous vehicles, pedestrians might think, "I don't care if it's green or red, I'll just walk, you won't dare hit me." So, regardless of the light, the car must stop.

Speaker 2:
Let me ask you a question first. Would you dare to hit someone?

Speaker 1:
Of course not.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, you wouldn't. So, under no circumstances should you hit someone. If it's a green light and pedestrians should yield to you, but they don't, they might be thinking, "Let's see if you'll hit me." In practice, most people will proceed cautiously. No one wants to cause an accident, so you move slowly. You can't hit them, right?

Speaker 1:
As long as I move slowly, even if I touch them, it won't cause any harm.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Everyone encounters such situations. If someone deliberately throws themselves in front of your car, that's a scam. If your car is already moving forward and they still try to get hit, you can call the police. It's clear-cut. If it's a green light and they force their way, it's unreasonable. We can only move slowly and avoid collisions.

Speaker 1:
Another issue is that autonomous vehicles can't always judge a situation correctly. For instance, if someone is standing by the roadside, the vehicle can't tell if they intend to cross or just stand there.

Speaker 2:
Whether there are traffic lights or not...

Speaker 1:
Without traffic lights, if someone is standing by the roadside playing with their phone, the autonomous vehicle sees them but can't predict if they'll suddenly step forward.

Speaker 2:
In such cases, you should take several measures. If there are multiple lanes, try to move to the left, keeping a safe distance. Change lanes if necessary to maintain a safe distance.
Speaker 1:
If there are two or more lanes, try to stay to the left, keeping a safe distance. This helps in reducing the load when changing lanes. If there's no prohibition on honking, make sure to use the horn to alert others. The horn is there for a reason.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you need to give a safety signal. If someone is looking down at their phone and you’re moving forward, you must honk to let them know your car is coming. Are they going to wait for you or cross first? If they are standing far from the road and not moving, and your speed is around 40-50 mph, you might need to brake suddenly.

Speaker 1:
For example, if you’ve already turned and someone is standing on the side road.

Speaker 2:
Yes, in such cases, you should slow down and honk.

Speaker 1:
If they don’t move, then we proceed.

Speaker 2:
Right, if they don’t move, a normal person would step back. If they move forward when you slow down and honk, you must continue to slow down and let them pass. They might not be aware of the situation.

Speaker 1:
Sometimes in Beijing, there are barriers on the road.

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
They might step outside the barrier to catch a cab. But at that moment, you don’t know if they want to cross the road. Can you stop on such roads?

Speaker 2:
Theoretically, no.

Speaker 1:
No, you can’t.

Speaker 2:
Then don’t stop. Just slow down. If you can pass, then pass. If the pedestrian can’t cross, you must go first. Honk to signal them. This is your road, and you have the right of way. It’s not that drivers have no rights. You asked several questions, and we can think of many scenarios, but there will always be unexpected situations. What do you do then? Follow traffic regulations. Traffic laws are becoming more comprehensive.

Speaker 2:
Judgments are based on the designer’s perspective. Even if you ask 10,000 volunteers, you might get 5,000 solutions, but there will always be unforeseen situations. What then? Follow traffic regulations. In case of an accident, you need to rely on traffic laws and the police to resolve the issue.
Speaker 1:
In situations where traffic accidents are inevitable, you must always have a basis for dealing with the police and resolving traffic matters.

Speaker 2:
I understand. Alright, I think we can move on.

Speaker 1:
There's nothing you can do to completely avoid it.

Speaker 2:
You guys are back now. We also have data from a wristband, not just a handle. Passengers have a handle they can use.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I saw that.

Speaker 2:
If they feel uncomfortable, they can press the handle. Would you like to see the data on when they press it to understand their discomfort?

Speaker 1:
Do I have to look at it?

Speaker 2:
No, it's optional.

Speaker 1:
Alright, I won't look at it then.

Speaker 2:
Okay, haha. So, I think that concludes our interview for today.

Speaker 1:
OK, OK. Do I need to give you anything?

Speaker 2:
Yes, thank you for reminding me. I almost forgot. You need to fill out a form.

Speaker 1:
No problem, I won't forget. Here, use this pen.

Speaker 2:
I was just joking around.

Speaker 1:
It's fine, it's fine. It's my responsibility.

Speaker 2:
No worries, I just like to joke.

Speaker 1:
Please fill it out and leave it with me.

Speaker 2:
Let me think... I need to remember my card number.

Speaker 1:
Take your time. I'll tidy up here.

Speaker 2:
Sorry for keeping you after hours.

Speaker 1:
It's no problem at all.
