**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, it's hard to tell from the awkwardness. If the other files can be seated opposite, then it's fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, yes, let's add this to zero. Yes, hey, can you say something so I can hear you? Wait a moment.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you hear me?

**Speaker 1:**
Let me try. Maybe turn this on. Okay.

**Speaker 2:**
Hello.

**Speaker 1:**
Just in time, the door isn't closed. Wait a moment. Slightly. I can show you first, this is it, and it can cover 360 degrees.

**Speaker 2:**
I see, this is the last time.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, this is the last time. Yes. Yes, it should start from the fourth floor, you can see all of this, and the back as well.

**Speaker 1:**
The 11th floor? Oh, the 11th floor might not have water. It's you. Hmm, why don't you go to the camera and get it for him?

**Speaker 2:**
I tried, I don't have it.

**Speaker 1:**
Permission, can you check the driving cabin? Hey, it's okay, go check the driving cabin.

**Speaker 2:**
Really?

**Speaker 2:**
But driving this car feels different from our usual driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Does it feel very different?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would consider, because they have a comfort level, and I always think about this.

**Speaker 1:**
So you deliberately take care of their feelings, and it feels completely different from driving alone.

**Speaker 2:**
Not exactly, for example, if I brake hard, I will subconsciously check.

**Speaker 1:**
Check the passengers next to you.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, just a quick glance.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand.

**Speaker 2:**
Because usually when I drive, it's generally just me.

**Speaker 1:**
So today, are you feeling quite nervous? I feel.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and it's not my own car.

**Speaker 1:**
So you're not familiar with it, right?

**Speaker 2:**
But it's much better now, after several trips, I'm getting more relaxed.

**Speaker 1:**
No? No? Okay.

**Speaker 1:**
You can come in. And who asked this? Jingli asked where to record in the form, can you help me adjust it, and record the meeting minutes, he said he also records.

**Speaker 2:**
If you don't have a record, you can record it.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have it? The previous ones, the records up to now, don't you have them? You should have them, right? You can copy one.

**Speaker 2:**
It's a different issue, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**
It's okay, I have to start here. Hmm, okay, let's start with some simple questions. Just now in the car, I heard you say you are more used to driving SUVs and not so much sedans. Have you mainly driven SUVs before, which are higher? Besides SUVs, have you driven any other cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have also driven...
**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned that you are more accustomed to driving SUVs and might not be as comfortable with sedans. Have you mainly driven SUVs before? Besides SUVs, have you driven any other types of vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have also driven a school bus, but that was very rare, just a friend's vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever driven an electric car? If so, how did it feel?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have. The acceleration is very smooth and the braking feels very gentle, almost silky. I drove one shortly after I got my license.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you driven a car with some kind of driver assistance features, like cruise control or automatic following?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have. It was a Toyota.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it an SUV?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was a Lexus ES. It’s another car in our family, not the one I usually drive.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the driver assistance features? Do you remember your impressions?

**Speaker 2:**
I found that I used them less in the city but more on the highway, especially when there was no traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you remember how you felt using those features? Did you find them convenient or not very useful?

**Speaker 2:**
I found them quite useful. For example, if you get too close to the car in front, it automatically brakes for you.

**Speaker 1:**
Is that similar to adaptive cruise control?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it is. It maintains a certain distance and will alert you if you get too close. If you don't brake, it will do it for you, but not too harshly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think this feature is useful? Other drivers have mentioned it as well.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think it’s quite good, especially in the Lexus, which is a higher-end model. I also experienced it in a friend's Mercedes C260. He was driving aggressively on the highway, and a couple of times the car had to brake suddenly. The seatbelt tightened very quickly, which was a bit scary and uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
That sounds intense. Thank you for sharing your experience.
The car suddenly decelerated, and the seatbelt tightened abruptly. It felt quite scary and uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
The driver thought he could stop the car in time.

Speaker 2:
Maybe the driver couldn't.

Speaker 1:
He couldn't stop it, and the car assisted in braking. It was really close to a collision, but fortunately, it didn't happen.

Speaker 2:
I understand.

Speaker 1:
He made a quick turn, but I'm not sure if he turned the steering wheel.

Speaker 2:
Right, I'm not sure if it would have collided if he hadn't turned.

Speaker 1:
Okay. Do you usually drive long distances or short distances in the city? How many kilometers or how long do you usually drive?

Speaker 2:
I usually drive short distances in the city, around 10 kilometers on average.

Speaker 1:
So, it's generally from home to school?

Speaker 2:
No, it's usually from our home to another place, or taking the dog out for a walk. If we go out for fun, it's usually within Beijing, the suburbs, or nearby areas in Hebei.

Speaker 1:
So, within 100 kilometers?

Speaker 2:
No, sometimes it's more than 100 kilometers.

Speaker 1:
How did you feel driving our car today?

Speaker 2:
Well...

Speaker 1:
Just tell me your honest feelings.

Speaker 2:
It felt a bit...

Speaker 1:
Do you mean it was slow to accelerate or the brakes weren't responsive?

Speaker 2:
Maybe I'm not used to it. I'm more familiar with our own car. The throttle and brake pedals felt a bit stiff.

Speaker 1:
Yes, many drivers have mentioned that the brake pedal feels a bit strange. The first half feels like nothing, and then it suddenly brakes hard.

Speaker 2:
Today, I started braking from a distance.

Speaker 1:
Okay, let's review your entire driving process. I might ask about specific segments and your driving habits. For example, why did you drive a certain way?

Speaker 1:
In the parking lot, we can discuss other things. Think about your previous driving habits, like what you usually do when turning. What specific actions do you take and in what order?

Speaker 2:
For turning?

Speaker 1:
First, you brake.

Speaker 2:
Yes, slow down by braking, then...

Speaker 1:
Turn the steering wheel. What is your observation sequence? Do you have a habit of checking a particular side first?

Speaker 2:
It depends.
Speaker 1:
Slow down by pressing the brake, and then...

Speaker 2:
Turn the steering wheel. Do you have a specific order of observation, like which side you look at first?

Speaker 1:
Does it depend on the situation?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it depends.

Speaker 1:
For example, when making a left or right turn, right? Let's say you're making a right turn here, what do you do first?

Speaker 2:
I first look ahead and around me, then check the surroundings.

Speaker 1:
Do you check the left side as well?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I check the left side for any cars.

Speaker 1:
Did you see the red car at that time?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I did.

Speaker 1:
And you thought it was yielding to you, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it slowed down.

Speaker 1:
The camera view seems much wider than your actual perspective, doesn't it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I was clear about my surroundings.

Speaker 1:
Alright. So, this is the first turn after exiting the parking lot. How did you observe the surroundings? There are non-motorized vehicles and other cars on the main road.

Speaker 2:
I noticed that...

Speaker 1:
There were fewer cars today, and they were far away. And the non-motorized vehicles were not in sight.

Speaker 1:
Do you have any other habits when turning?

Speaker 2:
I usually brake first, then turn. If the speed drops too much, I might lightly press the accelerator.

Speaker 1:
When do you press the accelerator? After the car has exited the turn or during the turn?

Speaker 2:
Usually during the turn.

Speaker 1:
I noticed during the test drive that you tend to turn the steering wheel back slowly. Is that right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I let the steering wheel return slowly using the natural force of the tires straightening out, rather than actively turning it back.

Speaker 1:
If you were driving faster, would you actively turn the wheel back?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you grip the steering wheel tightly. Is that because your car has a non-slip cover?

Speaker 2:
Yes, my car has a non-slip latex cover, and I'm used to driving it with one hand. But with this car, I grip the wheel tightly to ensure control.

Speaker 1:
Next, we'll discuss merging from a side road to a main road. How do you usually handle lane changes?
Speaker 1:
Alright, so next, there will be a process of merging from a side road onto a main road. How do you usually handle situations like merging or entering a main road from a side road? Let's recall your driving habits without looking at anything for now.

Speaker 2:
Well, sometimes I feel like there are a lot of blind spots when I'm driving this car.

Speaker 1:
You mean visual blind spots?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I'm not sure if it's because I haven't adjusted the mirrors properly or something else.

Speaker 1:
Are you talking about the mirrors?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there are many areas I can't see.

Speaker 1:
I understand what you mean. For example, when you are about to enter the main road, sometimes the bushes can block your view, right?

Speaker 2:
Not exactly. Sometimes it might be because I'm driving an SUV, which is higher and has a wider view, but the A-pillar often blocks my view.

Speaker 1:
You mean the car's A-pillar?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it can block my view.

Speaker 1:
Could it also be an issue with the seat position? Are you sitting upright the whole time?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I am.

Speaker 1:
So, what can you see in the left side mirror?

Speaker 2:
The left side mirror is fine.

Speaker 1:
But you feel there are areas you can't see. Can you tell me where the blind spots are?

Speaker 1:
Is it mainly on the right side?

Speaker 2:
No, it's on the left side.

Speaker 1:
So, the blind spot is on the left side. Do you mean you can't see the cars on the left?

Speaker 2:
Yes, for example, when I want to see the road on the left.

Speaker 1:
Are you looking through the car window or the side mirror?

Speaker 2:
Through the side mirror.

Speaker 1:
And you can't see the cars?

Speaker 2:
Sometimes I have to lean forward to see.

Speaker 1:
But then something holds you back, and you can't lean forward enough, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
It might be because the seat is positioned a bit too far back, and the pillar behind you blocks your view. The seatbelt area has a pillar that obstructs your view, so you have to lean forward to see behind it. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's the feeling.

Speaker 1:
So, when you are in this situation and your view is limited, how do you ensure your safety?

Speaker 2:
I first move the car forward and straighten it out, then slowly merge in. I don't just turn in directly like some people do.

Speaker 1:
I see. So, you straighten the car first and then slowly turn the wheel to see the cars on the road. If there are no cars, you merge in, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1:
So, you slowly turn the steering wheel, and at this point, you can see the cars in this lane. Otherwise, you can't see them, right? Okay, and if there are no cars, then we can proceed. Right, and this section is actually a straight road with fewer cars, allowing for some acceleration. Yes, so when you usually drive on such straight roads with good conditions, at what speed do you typically maintain?

Speaker 2:
If there are no cars in front of me, I might go a bit faster.

Speaker 1:
For example, when you drive on the Fourth Ring Road, what speed do you usually maintain if there aren't many cars?

Speaker 2:
The speed limit on the Fourth Ring Road is 80 km/h. If there are no cars and no speed cameras, I usually drive at around 100 km/h.

Speaker 1:
So, you drive at 100 km/h if possible.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If there are cars, I slow down.

Speaker 1:
Got it. What about roads with a 60 km/h speed limit?

Speaker 2:
If there are no speed cameras and no cars, I also drive faster, but I stay in the inner lane to avoid sudden movements from the outer lane.

Speaker 1:
What is your usual following distance?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the speed.

Speaker 1:
For example, in this section, would you follow the car in front more closely or maintain a similar distance?

Speaker 2:
I would follow at a similar distance, but it also depends on the speed.

Speaker 1:
If you are driving at 60 km/h, what would be your following distance?

Speaker 2:
About half of what it is now.

Speaker 1:
Understood. You slowed down because of the red light ahead, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I didn't accelerate further.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Since we are on a test road, you might not have overtaken any cars. But when you usually change lanes or overtake, what are your driving habits?

Speaker 2:
My driving habits? For instance, earlier, before the electric car came, I would have overtaken it directly. I wouldn't wait. But today, I hesitated and let the electric car pass first. Normally, I would have just gone ahead.

Speaker 1:
Which car did you let pass?

Speaker 2:
The one in front earlier. If I were driving my own car, I would have overtaken it quickly. But today, I was more cautious and didn't change lanes immediately.

Speaker 1:
So, you didn't dare to change lanes directly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1:
So, you decided to cut in front of him, but driving this car makes you more cautious. I saw he was quite far from me, but I didn't dare to change lanes directly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you should wait for him to pass and then change lanes. How about overtaking? I don't think you did any overtaking today.

Speaker 1:
Usually, where do you overtake?

Speaker 2:
On any road, really. Highways, for example. Let's talk about highways because in cities like Beijing, other roads might not allow it, or at least it would be on ring roads or other highways.

Speaker 1:
When I overtake, I usually make sure there's a larger gap between the cars. If the distance is small, I won't try to squeeze through. I prefer a longer gap.

Speaker 2:
Yes, generally, if the distance between cars is larger, you feel more comfortable.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, and when you change lanes, you do it when there's enough space.

Speaker 2:
Yes, like when following a car at 60 mph, I would change lanes when there's a safe distance.

Speaker 1:
Before overtaking, you might not see the situation in the left lane clearly. Do you slightly steer left to check if there's enough space to overtake?

Speaker 2:
Not usually, unless I can't see clearly. But I won't cross the line; I stay within my lane.

Speaker 1:
Sometimes, you might slightly move the car's front out to check.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but normally, cars stay in the middle of their lanes.

Speaker 1:
What about making a U-turn? Can you recall your usual habit when you need to make a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
When I learned to drive, my family told me to stay close to the right line to make a U-turn in one go.

Speaker 1:
Yes, close to the right line.

Speaker 2:
But with this car, I don't control it as well, so I don't dare to steer too much to the right. When driving my family car, I would steer right first.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you are a bit hesitant about the right side distance.

Speaker 2:
Yes, even if I don't make it in one go, I still don't dare to move too much to the right.

Speaker 1:
A slight adjustment should be enough to make the turn.

Speaker 2:
Some drivers can make it in one go, but most can't.

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's true.
Speaker 1:
Some drivers can pass in one go, but most can't.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I try to be patient. Normally, I wouldn't wait that long while driving.

Speaker 1:
They moved ahead because the light was green, right? So, you had to wait. That's fine.

Speaker 2:
I waited until they all passed before I moved. Normally, if only the outer lane is clear...

Speaker 1:
You can go as long as the inner lane is clear, right? Got it.

Speaker 2:
Sometimes, you might need to brake a bit.

Speaker 1:
It feels like you could make the turn with a wider angle.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but the car's alarm went off, and I got nervous. It's okay.

Speaker 1:
I remember this spot; you were stuck here for a while. Why did you switch to the left lane? Was it because the bus let you in?

Speaker 2:
No, the bus just came in. Okay.

Speaker 1:
In situations like this, if you know you need to turn right but the bus is in the way, do you wait for it to move?

Speaker 2:
I feel the test road is too short. You have to turn every few steps.

Speaker 1:
Yes, and then there's another right turn. Do you feel your view is blocked when turning right?

Speaker 2:
A bit, so I slightly turned left.

Speaker 1:
I saw you turned a bit to the left. Is that right?

Speaker 2:
Not really. I was just being cautious. If a non-motorized vehicle is close, I go slowly.

Speaker 1:
It's good that there were fewer cars today.

Speaker 1:
Why did you decide to overtake?

Speaker 2:
It was too slow. The first time I went through the right turn, I couldn't see behind me clearly. A tricycle came without stopping or letting me pass. I had to brake.

Speaker 1:
You braked for a second.

Speaker 2:
Yes, not too hard, but I did brake. The tricycle passed and the driver looked at me, as if to say he wouldn't yield. I only saw him when he was right in front of my car.

Speaker 1:
You only saw him when he was right in front. Got it.

Speaker 1:
I have some other questions. To ensure safety during this drive...
Speaker 1:
I want to ask you some other questions. Since you haven't reached the intersection yet, to ensure the safety of this drive, what areas do you particularly focus on?

Speaker 2:
Particularly focus on?

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
I try to avoid any contact with pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 1:
Why do you feel more anxious?

Speaker 2:
Because this time, we happened to be driving when school was letting out.

Speaker 1:
So, school was over.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and generally, I am more afraid of electric bikes.

Speaker 1:
You are more afraid of electric bikes. Why is that?

Speaker 2:
Because they can squeeze through small gaps.

Speaker 1:
I see.

Speaker 2:
They don't consider the feelings of motor vehicle drivers. Even if there's a small gap, they will try to squeeze through. They might walk very close to you or suddenly dart out. They don't think much about it. If they are too close and I slightly steer away, I might hit them. Their sudden movements are quite scary.

Speaker 1:
By sudden movements, you mean they change direction quickly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they operate very quickly. Exactly.

Speaker 1:
So, you can't predict their next move, and they might suddenly change direction.

Speaker 2:
On side roads, bicycles are not as bad because they move slowly. But on non-motorized lanes, they might suddenly change direction without checking for motor vehicles. For example, they might try to avoid another bicycle.

Speaker 1:
So, they don't check if there are any non-motorized vehicles coming from behind. They just turn left from the right side of the non-motorized lane.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, they might suddenly occupy your lane. And if you don't react in time, it can be dangerous.

Speaker 1:
I understand.

Speaker 2:
I get very frustrated when I have to brake suddenly because of them. It shouldn't be necessary, and it makes the passengers uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
I see.

Speaker 2:
Even a slight brush against them can be concerning.

Speaker 1:
Which situation are you referring to?

Speaker 2:
When turning, just as I start to turn, I might slightly brush against them. I signal and move a bit, but it's still not very clear.

Speaker 1:
Actually, there are no cars on the right, but you still feel uneasy.

Speaker 2:
I slow down a bit, meaning if they can pass, they should, otherwise, they should stop and let me go first.

Speaker 1:
I understand. It feels like your field of vision narrows.

Speaker 1:
Can you recall your usual driving experiences?
Speaker 1: Let's start. I have some experience, but not much.

Speaker 1: I feel like my field of vision just narrowed when I pressed something.

Speaker 1: Can you recall any driving experiences where you felt particularly scared?

Speaker 2: Scared? For example, when driving on a road with many parked cars on the side.

Speaker 1: Yes, and then suddenly someone jumps out from between the cars.

Speaker 2: Either a person or a non-motorized vehicle, like a bicycle. Sometimes they don't realize there's a car behind them.

Speaker 1: They suddenly veer to the left.

Speaker 2: Yes, they suddenly change direction. I don't understand why they do that.

Speaker 1: At that moment, they might be moving very slowly and can't control their direction well. They might need to adjust their position.

Speaker 2: I don't understand them, so I pay extra attention.

Speaker 1: Wait, let me check the equipment.

Speaker 1: Just now, that non-motorized vehicle was very close to you, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, on the road, these electric bikes and bicycles often change direction without looking back.

Speaker 1: Because the large vehicles take up the non-motorized lane, the non-motorized vehicles end up in your lane.

Speaker 2: They could move further in, but they don't.

Speaker 1: Did you see the person standing ahead? Yes, it's very close.

Speaker 2: If they suddenly veer towards you, you wouldn't be able to stop in time. If they lose control, you'd definitely collide.

Speaker 2: Before I learned to drive, I knew that when riding a bicycle, I should look back before changing direction.

Speaker 1: But you see people running, talking on the phone, or riding with one hand, which makes it easy to suddenly change direction because they can't control their balance.

Speaker 2: They generally lack awareness.

Speaker 1: Besides situations like this, where someone suddenly jumps out or a non-motorized vehicle changes lanes, what other scenarios scare you while driving?

Speaker 2: I'm mostly afraid of hitting someone.

Speaker 1: What kind of people are you most afraid of hitting?

Speaker 2: People who lack safety awareness. They don't know when a car might come.

Speaker 1: Yes, they don't pay attention to the traffic.

Speaker 2: And those who cross the street without looking, even when the light is green for them. They walk slowly and don't pay attention to their surroundings.
Speaker 1: When he crosses the street, he just walks without looking around, even if the light is green for him. He walks very slowly and confidently.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. For example...

Speaker 1: But you were turning, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, but there's another thing that scares me. If I'm in the inner lane and there's a bus in the outer lane, both of us waiting at the red light, I usually don't rush when the light turns green because I can't see if someone might suddenly appear in front of the bus.

Speaker 1: I understand. You're worried that someone might suddenly dart out from in front of the bus.

Speaker 2: Yes, I usually wait for the bus to move first before I go.

Speaker 1: Got it. That's what we commonly refer to as a "ghost head" situation.

Speaker 2: And then there are those who run red lights.

Speaker 1: Electric bikes running red lights.

Speaker 1: Do you think you have any bad driving habits?

Speaker 2: Bad driving habits?

Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 2: When I encounter a very slow driver, I really want to overtake them, but sometimes I don't have the courage. I try to find a particularly safe opportunity to do so.

Speaker 1: So you get anxious and want to overtake, but you hesitate while driving.

Speaker 2: Yes, because sometimes there are oncoming cars.

Speaker 1: Or other situations, and you miss the opportunity.

Speaker 2: Yes, I'm afraid I won't have enough time or speed to overtake safely. If I accelerate too quickly, it doesn't feel right either. I get very frustrated and angry. I might want to curse at them, but I usually just curse inside the car. If I roll down the window, it doesn't help, and I just get more upset.

Speaker 1: When you're a passenger, what actions or behaviors from the driver make you feel very nervous or uneasy?

Speaker 2: When they brake suddenly.

Speaker 1: Sudden braking.

Speaker 2: And when they hesitate a lot or keep talking to me while driving. Sometimes it makes me feel scared.

Speaker 1: You feel quite scared.

Speaker 2: It's not too bad, but if they keep talking to me while driving, it makes me nervous. Generally, I can tell if someone is a good driver just by sitting in their car.

Speaker 1: You can feel it right away.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1: How do you judge if a driver is good or not?

Speaker 2: Before I got my license, I couldn't really tell.

Speaker 1: But now?

Speaker 2: Now that I have my license, even when my mom drives, I get scared. I think it's because everyone has a different way of thinking.

Speaker 1: You notice things that others might not.
Speaker 2:
After I got my license, I started feeling scared when my mom drives. I think it's because everyone has a different way of thinking.

Speaker 1:
You notice things that she might not be paying attention to.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. She might think it's okay to do something in a certain way, but if it were me...

Speaker 1:
You wouldn't dare to do it because you think it's risky.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but she might feel it's perfectly safe. I think I'm a decent driver compared to my peers, but my parents, who have been driving for over a decade, have a different perspective.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Do you remember any particularly dangerous situations from the last time you drove on a specific route? If not, we can move on.

Speaker 2:
There was one time when a large truck was coming towards me. There were cars parked on the side of the road, and the truck was straddling the line. If I had stayed in my lane, we would have collided. But since there were no cars on my side, I swerved a bit to avoid it.

Speaker 1:
Where was this? After you turned left?

Speaker 2:
Yes, after the left turn. But it wasn't really scary. 

Speaker 1:
In situations like this, when a non-motorized vehicle takes up your lane, you end up driving against traffic. Aren't you afraid of oncoming cars?

Speaker 2:
It depends on their attention. I always leave some space for them. 

Speaker 1:
So you leave space for the non-motorized vehicle?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and if there's enough room on both sides, it's not a big deal. I just adjust my position slightly.

Speaker 1:
I see.

Speaker 2:
But it was frustrating. I was annoyed at that moment.

Speaker 1:
Why? Because they were blocking the road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, first because they stopped there, and second because the woman didn't move. She stopped in a dangerous spot. I had to swerve to avoid her, which was annoying.

Speaker 1:
So you had to move to the right to let the black car pass, and then swerve back to the left?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and she was still there, so I had to adjust again. It was frustrating.
**Speaker 1:**
When you took that big turn, she was still there, so you had to move closer to this side, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I felt like he was being inconsiderate. Even if he had moved a bit forward, it would have been fine.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. So, in this situation, the truck was trying to overtake the three-wheeler and ended up in your lane?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he even swerved a bit towards me.

**Speaker 1:**
He saw you coming and decided not to overtake. Got it.

**Speaker 2:**
But you could have reversed a bit. He was actually encroaching quite a lot into my lane.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you first saw him from a distance, he was already taking up a lot of space in your lane?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and I noticed he didn't make any significant effort to move back. At that moment, there were no cars behind me, so I didn't feel the need to reverse.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Do you remember anything else about that situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
When you drive, do you usually consider the comfort of your passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
I mostly drive alone, so I don't think about it much.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't usually have passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, and today I was a bit nervous because I'm not used to driving so quietly. I usually play music when I drive.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. And having the equipment and people monitoring your driving made you more nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, having people in the car and knowing they were assessing my driving added pressure. I tried to be gentler with the brakes and accelerator.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think you have any driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes I brake a bit hard. When I'm alone, it doesn't matter, but with passengers, it might be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
What driving habits of others make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Speeding excessively.

**Speaker 1:**
Speeding excessively?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and frequent lane changes, especially on ring roads.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they change lanes very close to the car in front, brake suddenly, and then accelerate again?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. They change lanes, brake immediately, then accelerate again, which makes me uncomfortable.
Speaker 1:
So, I understand what you mean. After he overtakes, he immediately hits the brakes, then changes lanes again, and then accelerates a bit.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and when he changes to the right lane, he might want to overtake a car. He first brakes, then changes lanes, and the car in front might also brake, but there's no traffic jam.

Speaker 1:
Then he has to brake again.

Speaker 2:
After changing lanes, he gets very close to the car in front.

Speaker 1:
Yes, very close. If the car in front brakes...

Speaker 2:
He would have to brake hard. Even if the car in front doesn't brake, he still needs to brake lightly. Being so close to the car in front makes me feel uneasy.

Speaker 1:
After changing lanes, he immediately brakes, then accelerates again, and then changes back to his original lane. He keeps changing lanes to overtake cars on the ring road.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I think his speed is very different from the current traffic flow. He drives too fast, sometimes accelerating hard and braking hard. This makes me feel uncomfortable and dizzy.

Speaker 1:
Do you get car sick?

Speaker 2:
If I look at my phone, yes.

Speaker 1:
Looking at your phone makes you dizzy?

Speaker 2:
Yes. The only time I felt a bit uncomfortable driving myself was on a winding mountain road because of the constant turning.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Since you mentioned considering passenger comfort, what do you pay special attention to when driving with passengers?

Speaker 2:
I try to keep a safe distance from the car in front. I might brake a bit hard sometimes, but I try to avoid it. I also try to accelerate and brake smoothly, maintaining a steady speed.

Speaker 1:
So, it's mainly about braking, accelerating, and keeping a safe distance from the car in front.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I feel about 70-80% confident in my driving. I avoid risky maneuvers when I have passengers.

Speaker 1:
So, when you have passengers, you avoid slightly unsafe actions. But if you're driving alone, you might...

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I'm alone, I might take some risks, like making a quick U-turn if there's a big enough gap in traffic. But with passengers, I drive more cautiously to give them a comfortable ride.
If I were alone, I might have just turned and let the other driver go ahead, no problem. But because of the situation, I had to be a bit quicker to give others time to react. However, if I had passengers, I would take it slow, wait for all the cars to pass, and not rush. Normally, I drive quite fast, but today I was more relaxed.

Interviewer:
Hmm, would you want to see how passengers react by looking at their grip on the handles? 

Driver:
Yes, I would. Some drivers might not want to look, but I do. 

Interviewer:
Alright, let's continue watching. 

Driver:
Sure. 

Interviewer:
What do you usually do in emergencies? 

Driver:
I might honk or flash the headlights. 

Interviewer:
High beams? 

Driver:
Yes, usually. 

Interviewer:
I need to ask you specifically about this intersection. It's an important one without traffic lights. How do you usually handle it?

Driver:
If there are no cars, I would look carefully, brake, and then proceed. But since there was a car in front of me, I tried to follow it. 

Interviewer:
So, if you think the car in front can make it, you can too?

Driver:
Yes, but I also checked the other side. There was a taxi blocking the way, so I felt more relaxed.

Interviewer:
So, the taxis helped block the traffic for you?

Driver:
Yes, they did. I should have followed the car in front a bit closer.

Interviewer:
Got it. Let's continue. 

Interviewer:
Today, you didn't follow as closely. Will this section be congested for long?

Driver:
No, it wasn't too long, just a bit of time.

Driver:
I didn't see a car that was about to turn left. I thought it would just stop briefly and go, but it didn't.

Interviewer:
When merging onto the main road, was this the Fourth Ring Road?

Driver:
Yes, the North Fourth Ring Road.

Interviewer:
How did you observe the traffic?

Driver:
I tried to inch forward to get a better view of the left side.

Interviewer:
So you could see the left side better?

Driver:
Yes, I inched forward without obstructing others, allowing them to see me as well. I was preparing to turn right, so I stopped briefly.
Speaker 1:
And then let others see it.

Speaker 2:
Yes, so the idea is that I need to make a right turn, so I stopped for a moment.

Speaker 1:
You stopped, and then what would you do next?

Speaker 2:
After that, I would check both sides. If there are no vehicles or if the non-motorized vehicles are far away, then...

Speaker 1:
By non-motorized vehicles, do you mean those going straight or those coming from your right?

Speaker 2:
Going straight. If they are coming from the right, they would be coming from behind, so they probably wouldn't be an issue because I have already signaled my intention to turn. They should know I am going that way, so it shouldn't be a problem.

Speaker 1:
But even if they come from there, it's wide enough, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it wouldn't be an issue. They would just pass in front of my car.

Speaker 1:
Got it.

Speaker 1:
Since you knew you were about to make a right turn, why did you move to the left lane, the middle lane? Can I ask the reason?

Speaker 2:
It was because there was a...

Speaker 1:
A bus, a public bus, and you wanted to overtake it, right?

Speaker 1:
Were you afraid of getting too close to that intersection?

Speaker 2:
Actually, I was a bit scared. I was checking the navigation and looking ahead.

Speaker 1:
Because the bus was blocking your view, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and the intersection was quite narrow. So, I was already looking for the turn.

Speaker 1:
The turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and I slowed down.

Speaker 1:
For pedestrians crossing the road, I noticed that you judged there was enough time for them to cross.

Speaker 2:
My speed wasn't very fast.

Speaker 1:
Your speed wasn't very fast, and I didn't see you brake hard, maybe just a little.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I probably just eased off the accelerator.

Speaker 1:
So, when you encounter pedestrians crossing the road, what do you usually do?

Speaker 2:
If they look at me, I know they see me. But if they don't, I honk lightly to alert them. Just a quick honk, so as not to scare them. Some people might get startled and stop in the middle of the road.

Speaker 1:
Oh, if they get scared, they might stop and not move. Many people might not know if you are going to drive straight through.

Speaker 2:
Yes, some people get startled and just stand there. Others might do it on purpose, thinking you are being aggressive with the horn, and they block your way.

Speaker 1:
So, you just give a slight honk to remind them.

Speaker 1:
What do you think makes a good or professional driver? What should they at least be able to do?

Speaker 2:
Good driving skills are essential.
**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a good or professional driver? What are the essential qualities they should have?

**Speaker 2:**
A good driver needs to have excellent driving skills and a comprehensive approach to driving.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by excellent driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
It means being able to control the brake and accelerator smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, controlling the brake and accelerator, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles, and handling the car smoothly.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, avoiding sudden jerks.

**Speaker 1:**
So, not making abrupt movements, like slamming the brakes or flooring the accelerator.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, for instance, when I drive, I try to make sure my braking and accelerating are smooth so passengers don't feel sudden changes.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the goal is to make sure passengers don't feel abrupt accelerations or decelerations. You also mentioned that besides good driving skills, a driver should be considerate. What do you mean by that?

**Speaker 2:**
A driver should avoid actions that scare passengers.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of actions are you referring to?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, sudden lane changes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean a driver should consider the comfort and safety of passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, otherwise passengers might feel the driver is unreliable. For instance, experienced drivers don't make sudden lane changes, which are often done by younger drivers seeking thrills.

**Speaker 1:**
I've heard that experienced drivers tend to be more considerate of other vehicles and people on the road. They think ahead about whether their actions might cause problems for others.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, mutual courtesy on the road is important.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. What do you think is the biggest difference between new drivers and those with many years of experience?

**Speaker 2:**
The main difference is in what they consider while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate on that?

**Speaker 2:**
Experienced drivers pay more attention to their surroundings. For example, they check multiple directions when turning and consider the speed and angle of their turns. They anticipate and plan their moves in advance.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they are more proactive in their driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they handle situations smoothly. New drivers might not think as far ahead and may need to make adjustments on the spot, which can be challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
Experienced drivers plan ahead, so they don't need to make last-minute adjustments. Got it. Let's continue watching the rest of the video.
Speaker 1:
Then we need to adjust. Yes, experienced drivers might anticipate and adjust without needing to do it at the last moment. Understood. Let's finish watching the remaining video, and then I have a few more questions. After that, I'll show you the data from the handle controls.

Speaker 2:
Right, like that car earlier, it poked its nose out first, and when I saw it...

Speaker 1:
Yes, the white car.

Speaker 2:
I slowed down to let it go. If it hadn't poked its nose out and just went straight...

Speaker 1:
Then you wouldn't have let it go.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If I hadn't slowed down, it would have been quite scary. So, I think it's important for a car to poke its nose out first.

Speaker 1:
Right. Up ahead, there's another intersection without traffic signals, and you need to make a left turn, which is more challenging.

Speaker 2:
But there's a car in front of us.

Speaker 1:
Let's see. Oh, you followed that car because you judged it was moving slowly, so you didn't let it go.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and it saw me too. It wasn't just looking up; it saw me.

Speaker 1:
So, it slowed down a bit to let you pass. Got it. What aspects do you think autonomous cars can never handle as well as humans?

Speaker 2:
Probably the mutual understanding between drivers and pedestrians, like when making a turn.

Speaker 1:
Mutual understanding.

Speaker 2:
For example, an autonomous car might stop to let a pedestrian go first, but the pedestrian might be expecting the car to go first, which could cause delays.

Speaker 1:
Eye contact, you mean. You were able to make eye contact with the pedestrian to confirm their intentions.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I saw them. They might not have made eye contact with me, but they saw the car. Normally, pedestrians would step back when they see a car.

Speaker 1:
Do you think the pedestrian was looking at you or the car?

Speaker 2:
At the car.

Speaker 1:
You think they were looking at the car.

Speaker 2:
I was looking at them.

Speaker 1:
If they couldn't see you through the car's window...

Speaker 2:
They would still...

Speaker 1:
Would they still expect the car to stop for them, or would they be unsure?

Speaker 2:
It's hard to gauge. Sometimes, even I can't predict their intentions. I watch their movements. For instance, once I was driving alongside an electric scooter, and we both hesitated, thinking the other would go first, then both stopped, then both went again. It was confusing.
Speaker 1: So, as we were driving, we both thought the other was going to go, then we both stopped. Then we realized neither of us was moving, so we both started again, and then stopped again. It was quite frustrating, and the other driver glared at me for a while because we ended up quite close to each other with all the stopping and starting.

Speaker 2: Yes, that can be quite annoying. Do you have any suggestions on how to avoid such situations?

Speaker 1: Or how can we better communicate our intentions to pedestrians and other non-motorized road users?

Speaker 2: I think this often happens at intersections, especially when turning. Usually, I think it's best to yield a bit, like stopping to let them pass. But sometimes, especially at busy intersections like the one near our home at East Third Ring Road, people don't think much about it. They just move in groups, thinking that as pedestrians, they have the right of way. If a car keeps stopping, it might detect people continuously, and the car won't be able to move. The light might change, but pedestrians might still cross. So, sometimes, we drivers inch forward slowly to signal our intention to move, and eventually, pedestrians will let us pass.

Speaker 1: So, you mean you slowly inch forward to communicate to pedestrians that you intend to turn or move forward and that you don't want to yield indefinitely?

Speaker 2: Not exactly. Pedestrians often think that if they have the green light, they can go, and if a car hits them, it's the driver's fault. They also feel safer in groups, thinking the car won't move forward. So, my point isn't just about inching forward. It's about mutual respect. When pedestrians have the green light, they can cross, but they should also allow cars to move when it's their turn. 

Speaker 1: I understand.

Speaker 2: So, by moving slowly, pedestrians might realize that cars need to move too, and they might stop or walk behind the car when they can't go around it.

Speaker 1: You also mentioned that you observe the actions of pedestrians and other vehicles to judge their intentions. How do you make these judgments, aside from eye contact?

Speaker 2: I usually keep my foot near the brake, ready to stop if needed.
Speaker 1: Besides the eye contact you mentioned earlier, what other techniques do you use?

Speaker 2: I usually keep my foot hovering over the brake. I might not always press it, but I'm ready to if needed. It's my way of staying prepared, even though my judgment might not always be perfect.

Speaker 1: How do you decide whether a car is going to move, stop, or turn? Do you look at their indicators or their movement?

Speaker 2: Yes, I look at their indicators and their movement patterns. If a car suddenly slows down, it might be preparing to stop or turn.

Speaker 1: So, if a car slows down, it could be stopping, turning, or reacting to something ahead. What about pedestrians?

Speaker 2: Pedestrians are trickier. If they need to turn, they might signal it, but it's not always clear. I try to anticipate their actions by observing their behavior and the situation around them. For example, if their path is blocked, they might change direction.

Speaker 1: Let's say there's a crosswalk without traffic lights, and someone is standing there. How do you determine if they're waiting for someone or about to cross the street?

Speaker 2: In such cases, if they're in my way, I might honk lightly or make eye contact to see if they acknowledge me. If they don't respond, I might roll down the window and ask them to move aside. This way, whether they're crossing or waiting, they understand my intention.

Speaker 1: In crowded intersections where traffic signals are ineffective, how do you navigate through?

Speaker 2: In those situations, I slowly inch forward, looking for gaps to move through. If I wait too long, I might never get through because people keep coming.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about your driving today? Do you think your passengers felt comfortable?

Speaker 2: I wonder if they thought I was too slow or hesitant.

Speaker 1: By "too slow," do you mean you were waiting for others to go first?

Speaker 2: Yes, I was cautious and often waited for others to pass.

Speaker 1: Let's take a look at the footage to see how it went.

Speaker 2: Sure, I glanced over there and saw no cars.

Speaker 1: Alright, let's review the rest.
Speaker 1: Let the pedestrian go first.

Speaker 1: Take a look at this combination of objects.

Speaker 2: I glanced over there. I can see it.

Speaker 1: There are no cars over there.

Speaker 1: This is also a long straight stretch, so it felt like you came back very quickly on your last trip. It seemed like it only took about ten minutes. Did you take the wrong route earlier because of navigation issues?

Speaker 2: Yes, the navigation had some issues, and the intersections were too small, so I kept missing them.

Speaker 1: It's okay. We noticed those intersections before and also took the wrong turns. This time, you made the U-turn in one go.

Speaker 2: I did it in one go before as well.

Speaker 1: Yes, during the test drive. Do you remember asking me about it? We first made a left turn and then wrote it down.

Speaker 2: It was a green light, so I waited a bit. I could have gone without waiting, but I decided to wait.

Speaker 1: Wait for what?

Speaker 2: For the U-turn light.

Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Maybe it was the previous intersection.

Speaker 2: Yes, it might have been the previous one. I think I missed it the first and second times.

Speaker 1: What kind of vehicle was it?

Speaker 2: It was a van. At that intersection, I didn't need to wait for the green light to make a U-turn.

Speaker 1: But it blocked your way?

Speaker 2: It didn't block me completely. The van was also trying to make a U-turn, but it was waiting in a way that took up one and a half lanes. This made it difficult for me to make the turn directly.

Speaker 1: Oh, so it blocked your view, and you couldn't enter the side road.

Speaker 2: Yes, it blocked my view. I couldn't see if there was an oncoming car.

Speaker 1: I understand. It didn't block both lanes, but it blocked one, and you couldn't see the oncoming traffic.

Speaker 2: Exactly. The van was hesitating about making the U-turn, which caused me to wait. The lady in the car even suggested I could go straight.
Speaker 2:
Should I make a U-turn?

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's right. So, I ended up waiting there for a while, and several cars passed by. The lady in the car even told me I could go straight, but I said I couldn't see if there were any cars coming from the opposite direction.

Speaker 2:
You mean the one on your right?

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
There shouldn't be anything behind you on the right. Let me show you this. This one shows all zeros, which means it didn't register any input from the handle.

Speaker 1:
So, it didn't detect anything?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. And there might be an issue with our data collection, as it didn't register the handle being pressed.

Speaker 1:
5.065 seconds, 5.13 seconds, 12 minutes and 10.2 seconds, 13 seconds, 2.16 seconds, 4.19 seconds, 5.10 seconds, 10.5 minutes. Okay, let's take a look here. 5.065 liters, this doesn't match. Where is this? Do we have the departure time?

Speaker 2:
The departure time, you mean the first one?

Speaker 1:
Yes, the time the car left.

Speaker 2:
The estimated departure time.

Speaker 1:
Or you can tell me where 5.06 is? 5.03? Oh, that’s close enough.

Speaker 2:
Not very good. Right, so...

Speaker 1:
It's okay. I can check it later and let you know roughly where they are. This place doesn't have it.

Speaker 2:
No need to worry about it.

Speaker 1:
It's fine, it's fine. This is something we needed to analyze anyway. If you're interested, I can ask you more about the situation at that time. There are still people interviewing Chen Ke and others, so we can ask them why they felt uncomfortable. Alright, I don't have any other questions for now. I'll give you this form to fill out because we offer compensation.

Speaker 2:
Should I fill it out now?

Speaker 1:
Yes, please fill it out now. Here's a pen. Thank you, Mr. Qiang. By the way, do you live near Jintai Road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I live near Palm Springs.

Speaker 1:
I see. I used to go to school near Mingfu. Oh, so we were high school classmates. Alright, that's all for now. I'll take you downstairs. 

Speaker 2:
Okay, thank you. It's been a long day. I'll head out now. 

Speaker 1:
No problem, take care.
