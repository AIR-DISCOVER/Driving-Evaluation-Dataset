**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, wait, it should be fine now, I think. Maybe I feel that this mic should be okay, but why does it feel so... way? Hmm, I'll start the transcription.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in a moment, you will see a video on your eye tracker. It will show a focal point and the part you were looking at. It's not exactly focusing, but where your eyes were directed.

**Speaker 1:**
I'm ready. Can you help me test drive this setup? The computer is ready, why?

**Speaker 1:**
Please wear this microphone. Got it? Okay, then I'll let it run, and you should be good. The computer password is 222333. No worries, everything is set. So, let's start the interview now. Yes, let me introduce myself again. My name is Changchang, and I will be conducting this final interview. Once the computer is set up, we will watch the eye-tracking video I mentioned earlier. If you find anything interesting, we can pause and discuss it. I will also ask you some questions if I think it's necessary. If there are any questions you don't want to answer, just let me know, and we can skip them. We want this to be a relaxed and natural conversation, just like chatting normally. All our records will be anonymous, so your name won't be disclosed in any recordings or videos. Before we watch the video, I'll ask you some simple questions. What types of cars have you driven before this experiment? For example, gasoline cars, electric cars, SUVs, or sedans?

**Speaker 2:**
I have driven sedans, SUVs, and electric cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Which type do you drive most frequently?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually drive SUVs and sedans.

**Speaker 1:**
What brand was the electric car you drove?

**Speaker 2:**
It was a Volkswagen electric car.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it a hybrid or fully electric?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not quite sure.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you driven any cars with assisted driving features, like adaptive cruise control?

**Speaker 2:**
The electric car seemed to have some features like that.

**Speaker 1:**
Did it have adaptive cruise control and automatic start-stop at traffic lights?
Speaker 1: Does your car have any driver assistance features? Like adaptive cruise control?

Speaker 2: Yes, it does.

Speaker 1: So, it has adaptive cruise control and automatic start-stop? It can automatically stop at red lights and start again when they turn green?

Speaker 2: Yes, it has that feature.

Speaker 1: And it can also keep the car centered in the lane?

Speaker 2: Yes, it can. I don't even need to touch the steering wheel; it drives itself.

Speaker 1: How did you feel using that feature?

Speaker 2: Not great. I didn't feel safe. I still prefer to control the car myself.

Speaker 1: Why did you feel unsafe? Was it because there were many cars around you?

Speaker 2: No, even when there were no cars around, it didn't stay perfectly centered in the lane. It would suddenly make small adjustments, which was scary. I kept my hands on the wheel just in case.

Speaker 1: So, you didn't feel comfortable letting go of the wheel completely?

Speaker 2: Exactly. It would suddenly make a move on its own, and that was unsettling.

Speaker 1: I understand. Do you usually drive short distances in the city or do you take long trips?

Speaker 2: Mostly short distances in Beijing, but I've driven to other provinces occasionally.

Speaker 1: How long is your average commute in Beijing?

Speaker 2: Each trip is at least half an hour.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about driving our car today?

Speaker 2: It's okay, but the visibility is a bit different.

Speaker 1: Do you usually drive an SUV?

Speaker 2: Yes, I prefer a higher driving position.

Speaker 1: So, you feel this car is a bit low?

Speaker 2: Yes, the seat is a bit low, and with all the equipment, it feels different.

Speaker 1: One more question, which might be a bit sensitive: Have you ever been in a traffic accident?

Speaker 2: No, I haven't.

Speaker 1: Alright, we'll adjust the sound settings. In a moment, we'll watch a video together, and I'll ask you about your actions in different driving scenarios like turning at intersections, making U-turns, and driving on highways. We'll analyze your actions and compare them to your usual driving habits to see if they match. If they do, it confirms your habits. If not, I'll ask why you did things differently today.
Speaker 1:
Alright, let's start by sharing my screen. Have you started the voice recording? It hasn't been interrupted, right? Good. Let's also enable the subtitles and real-time transcription. This is the data we collected during our second official test drive. You can also recall and share your experiences from both the first and second test drives.

Speaker 1:
Could you describe your driving habits when making a turn? For instance, during our test, the first scenario involved a continuous right turn from a parking lot onto a service road. Can you describe your usual right-turn habits?

Speaker 2:
My right-turn habits? You mean my driving habits?

Speaker 1:
Yes, your driving habits. For example, which direction do you look at first?

Speaker 2:
When making a right turn, I first look to the left, especially for any non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 1:
So, you first check for non-motorized vehicles coming straight from the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, then I check for cars on the main road.

Speaker 1:
You check for cars on the main road after non-motorized vehicles because they are closer to you in the non-motorized lane, followed by the motorized lane.

Speaker 2:
Yes, non-motorized vehicles can appear suddenly and move quickly, so I check them first to avoid any sudden surprises.

Speaker 1:
After checking for non-motorized vehicles from the left, what do you do next?

Speaker 2:
I then look to the right to see if there are any oncoming vehicles or pedestrians. If there are no obstacles, I proceed with the turn.

Speaker 1:
Understood. During our test, we observed your eye movements. The red dots indicate where you were looking, and the red line shows the trajectory of your gaze. The camera captured your field of vision at that moment.

Speaker 1:
Your quick judgment on the left side might be because there weren't many vehicles on that road. We can review this in more detail later.

Speaker 1:
As you mentioned, you first check for non-motorized vehicles and then for cars. This aligns with your driving habits.
**Speaker 1:**
So, let's take a look at this situation here.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure.

**Speaker 1:**
As you mentioned, you are assessing the non-motorized vehicles on the left and the cars on the right. Got it. And earlier, you were checking the non-motorized vehicles on the right side, correct? In this frame?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I see it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you make a right turn, do you prefer to stay close to the right side or keep some distance from it?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer to keep some distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you concerned about non-motorized vehicles on the right side?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Understood. Now, let's look at a scenario where you are merging from a service road onto a main road. Can you describe your usual approach when merging?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually check for vehicles coming from behind on the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
By "behind," you mean the vehicles approaching from the rear?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed that you frequently check the right side for non-motorized vehicles. Is that because you feel they might encroach on your lane?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I need to see how they are driving because they are less predictable. So, I try to keep a safe distance from them.

**Speaker 1:**
When you see a non-motorized vehicle moving to the right, do you tend to accelerate to overtake it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I try to pass them safely.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed that when the non-motorized vehicle moved to the right, you accelerated. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I try to keep a safe distance from them.

**Speaker 1:**
I also noticed that your speed increased. Initially, you were going around 20-30 km/h, but then you accelerated to overtake. Is that right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I accelerated to pass them safely.

**Speaker 1:**
When a non-motorized vehicle encroaches on your lane and doesn't yield, what do you usually do?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's my lane, I will honk. If there are many vehicles, I will slow down and proceed cautiously.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if a delivery vehicle is in front of you, what do you do?

**Speaker 2:**
I follow it at a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you find it dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially if it's moving fast.

**Speaker 1:**
When merging from a service road, do you wait until there are no cars on the main road, or do you merge when there is a gap?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually wait until there are no cars before merging.
**Speaker 1:** So, when you usually drive, do you wait until there are no cars at all before entering the main road, or do you accelerate when there's a safe distance?

**Speaker 2:** I accelerate when there's a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:** Were you able to see the road conditions behind you at that time? I mean, the conditions on the main road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you can see when you look back.

**Speaker 1:** Really? Because from your rearview mirror, it seems like the main road is completely blocked by the bushes.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:** This is the side road, and the main road is behind it. You have to move forward to see it. There is a car there.

**Speaker 2:** So, when turning, you first move forward a bit to get a better view.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, you need to move forward a bit to see clearly.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you can't see it initially. Move forward a bit, then you can see it.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. You saw that the taxi was still quite far away when you entered. Then, there is a straight section of the road after the U-turn. How do you usually maintain your speed on straight roads? For example, on roads with good conditions and a speed limit of 60 km/h, what speed do you usually maintain?

**Speaker 2:** Just a bit below the speed limit, not exceeding it.

**Speaker 1:** Today, you were probably going at most 50 km/h.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, mainly because the traffic on these roads doesn't allow for higher speeds.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Do you often drive on the ring roads or more on the outskirts?

**Speaker 2:** I drive more in the outskirts.

**Speaker 1:** And what's the usual speed limit there?

**Speaker 2:** It varies. Sometimes you have to slow down for speed cameras and then accelerate again. It's normal.

**Speaker 1:** But on roads with good conditions and no speed cameras, how fast do you usually go?

**Speaker 2:** Generally, on the wider roads in Changping, I can go around 90-100 km/h.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. And what distance do you usually keep from the car in front when driving at 80 km/h?

**Speaker 2:** About this much distance.

**Speaker 1:** Is that too far or just right?

**Speaker 2:** Not too close, just about right.

**Speaker 1:** So, at 80 km/h, you keep this distance.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, about that.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. That's roughly a 3-second gap. And if you're going at 60 km/h or slower, the distance would be shorter.
Speaker 2:
Hmm, almost.

Speaker 1:
Got it, so roughly 3 solutions in 15 seconds. Right. Then let's continue. But if it's 60 mph or slower, it might be a bit closer. Is 60 mph closer than it is now?

Speaker 2:
A bit closer.

Speaker 1:
A bit closer.

Speaker 2:
Yeah, about that.

Speaker 1:
60 mph is about like this. Two cars at 60 mph would be about 10 meters apart, right? Okay, let's keep going. You can go ahead. If this part takes too long, I can move on.

Speaker 2:
Not long, the front is all U-turns. Actually, the first two times, because I wasn't familiar, I reversed a bit because I knew the route better, and there weren't many cars around, so I swerved a bit. I understand.

Speaker 1:
You mean you turned the steering wheel to the right, I see. You had already turned it.

Speaker 2:
Right? A bit further ahead.

Speaker 1:
So at this point, you had already started turning right early on.

Speaker 2:
A little bit. Yes, because there were no cars behind, I looked to the right early.

Speaker 1:
At this point, the steering wheel is straight, and then you start to make small adjustments. Right.

Speaker 2:
Because it was the third time, I knew the distance, so I could adjust and make the turn in one go.

Speaker 1:
When you make U-turns on familiar roads, do you also start turning the wheel to the right a bit early to leave more space for the left turn?

Speaker 2:
Because this road is a bit narrow, I can't make the turn in one go. On familiar roads, I usually don't need to turn right first.

Speaker 1:
So you don't need to turn right first.

Speaker 2:
Right, right.

Speaker 1:
This time it was a U-turn at a red light, right? And there were no oncoming cars, so it was easier to make the turn. Okay. After the U-turn, on this straight road, you should have a clear end point. Since there were basically no cars ahead, can you describe how you usually accelerate? If you encounter the same road conditions, how do you gradually accelerate? Do you usually drive a gasoline car or an electric car? A gasoline car, right? When you start accelerating in a gasoline car, do you keep an eye on the RPM? Do you look at the tachometer?

Speaker 2:
Not really. I only look at the speedometer.

Speaker 1:
Got it.

Speaker 1:
There's a right turn ahead. Because there's a bus stop ahead, you keep a safe distance from the car in front and don't overtake it. Right, because...

Speaker 2:
I know it's not too close or too far, so I don't overtake.

Speaker 1:
When you encounter large vehicles, do you usually follow them or overtake them on the left?

Speaker 2:
I try not to get too close to them.
Speaker 1:
When you encounter large vehicles on the road, do you usually choose to follow them or overtake them?

Speaker 2:
I try to avoid getting too close to them.

Speaker 1:
So, you maintain a greater following distance when there's a large vehicle in front of you compared to your usual following distance?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because they block the view, and I can't see anything ahead.

Speaker 1:
Here, there's a right turn, and the bushes obstruct your view. Were you able to see any assistance or indicators?

Speaker 2:
I would look behind me to check.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, I noticed you couldn't see through the rearview mirror, so you used the right-side window to look. You also glanced to the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because there were non-motorized vehicles on that side. I was checking to see if they were coming.

Speaker 1:
So, you confirmed that there were no vehicles coming from the right, and the road conditions were good.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the second lap was quite smooth.

Speaker 1:
The first lap had more traffic, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the first lap had more cars, and the road was more congested. The second lap felt faster and smoother.

Speaker 1:
I see. The second lap only took 14 minutes. During this situation, the large vehicle or taxi was occupying the non-motorized lane, which could cause non-motorized vehicles to enter the main road and block your path. What were your thoughts at that moment?

Speaker 2:
I noticed the large vehicle early on. When it came out, I kept an eye on it and my surroundings. I judged that the driver saw me and was letting me go first.

Speaker 1:
Did you notice any specific actions from the driver?

Speaker 2:
I saw the driver turn his head, so I knew he saw me.

Speaker 1:
So, you use the head-turning behavior of non-motorized vehicle drivers to judge whether they will yield to you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I pay close attention to pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles because they can be unpredictable and unsafe. I want to avoid collisions and understand their movements.

Speaker 1:
Let's look at the right turn again. Were you checking the rearview mirror or something else at that moment?
Speaker 1:
Alright, let's take a look at the right turn. At that moment, were you checking your side mirror or looking at the bicycle you just passed? It’s clear now that it’s in our lane, and you quickly glanced to the left. You were unsure, but they should have had a red light, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, yes, they had a red light, so they wouldn’t come over. I felt safe to turn right. 

Speaker 1:
During the second experiment, do you recall any potentially dangerous situations?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there was a delivery rider who didn’t move to the side or speed up. We were stuck in a situation where neither of us could pass.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Which part of the road was this? We can focus on that area later.

Speaker 2:
It was probably in the latter part of the route.

Speaker 1:
Did you attempt to overtake any vehicles during the second experiment?

Speaker 2:
No, there weren’t many cars to overtake.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Could you describe your usual overtaking habits?

Speaker 2:
When I overtake, I check how far the car behind me is. If there’s a safe distance, I accelerate.

Speaker 1:
How close do you consider too close?

Speaker 2:
If the car behind me is too close, I won’t overtake or change lanes.

Speaker 1:
So, you usually overtake on the left?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I only overtake on the left unless it’s extremely congested and I have to go right.

Speaker 1:
Did you notice the school zone ahead? Do you usually pay attention to such markings?

Speaker 2:
The markings are often too low to see clearly.

Speaker 1:
But you do look for them?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I find standing signs easier to notice.

Speaker 1:
You mean the upright school signs indicating a crossing?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. 

Speaker 1:
And for left turns, what’s your usual habit? Do you look right first, then left?

Speaker 2:
For left turns, I look left first, then right.

Speaker 1:
So, you look left first, then right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because the cars are coming from the left, so I check there first.

Speaker 1:
I understand. So, you turn left while checking the left side first, then the right.
**Speaker 1:**
I understand, so you mean you first check the left side before making a turn. And then you also consider the strategy for the right turn, ensuring there's no overlap in the driving path.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because when I make a left turn, I need to ensure that the lane is clear. So, I always check the left side first.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you make a left turn, you first look to the left, and then you check the right side to see if there are any pedestrians or other vehicles, correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. After making the left turn, I then check the right side to see if there are any oncoming vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. This process seems straightforward. Do you want to highlight anything specific? We will soon approach an intersection, and there might not be much to discuss during that segment. Can I ask you some other questions in the meantime?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, go ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
To ensure safety during this drive, what aspects do you particularly focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
I am most concerned about electric vehicles, especially e-bikes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you pay special attention to them?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, electric bikes and motorcycles, those vehicles where people are more exposed.

**Speaker 1:**
You usually pay attention to these in your daily driving, and you did the same this time?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides non-motorized vehicles, what else do you focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
Pedestrians and cyclists, mainly people. I focus a lot on them.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you are more concerned about people on the road than other vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
If a car suddenly appears in front of you, how do you handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
I would slow down and carefully maneuver around it.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you recall any specific driving experiences where you felt particularly scared or found it difficult to handle?

**Speaker 2:**
I find it particularly challenging and scary when making turns at intersections with a lot of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you referring to those complex intersections near ring roads where you need to make a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Not exactly, more like...

**Speaker 1:**
Can you give an example of a specific route or intersection that you find memorable?

**Speaker 2:**
For instance, intersections near shopping malls where there is heavy pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Turning or entering parking lots in such areas can be very stressful and prone to accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides these scenarios, are there any other situations that you find particularly frightening?
Speaker 1: It's easy to have an accident in such situations, so I get very nervous.

Speaker 2: Besides these scenarios, are there any other situations that make you feel scared?

Speaker 1: Well, maybe driving on a road for the first time makes me a bit more cautious and nervous.

Speaker 2: For example, the first time I drove on a certain road, I didn't drive very slowly, nor did I speed up. But by the third time, I felt much more comfortable.

Speaker 1: What are some of your past driving experiences? Even if there were no accidents or dangerous situations, are there any moments that still make you feel a bit scared when you think about them?

Speaker 2: Yes, there was one time when I went to Datong. Datong is on the Loess Plateau, and there are many winding roads. I encountered a blind curve where I couldn't see anything ahead.

Speaker 1: Was there no mirror to help you see around the curve?

Speaker 2: No, there were no mirrors or road signs. It was an S-shaped curve.

Speaker 1: Were you going downhill or uphill? Was it a right turn?

Speaker 2: I was making a left turn uphill, and then it turned into a downhill. I was worried about oncoming traffic, so I slowed down, but another car didn't slow down and drifted around the curve. I saw its tires skidding towards me.

Speaker 1: Did the other driver panic and lose control?

Speaker 2: Yes, they panicked and almost crossed into my lane. When they saw me, they quickly corrected their course and went back to their lane. Their rear tires skidded as well. It was really scary because the area was surrounded by high loess, and there was nothing but dirt, no trees or anything to see.

Speaker 1: Are there any other situations that make you feel scared or think there is a danger?

Speaker 2: Large trucks make me nervous, especially when they take up my lane while avoiding oncoming traffic on narrow roads.

Speaker 1: And you can't do anything about it because it's a big truck.

Speaker 2: Exactly, I can't avoid them, so I just drive slowly and carefully.

Speaker 1: You have to inch your way through the narrow space.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. And then there's a curve ahead, which is another critical point because there are no traffic signals. The vehicle in front of me just stays there, not speeding up or moving aside.
Speaker 1: Is this the flying car you mentioned?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's the one. It kept staying in front of me, and its speed didn't increase.

Speaker 1: It didn't move to the side either?

Speaker 2: Right. And on the left, there were those extended lanes, possibly with many parked cars.

Speaker 1: So you were afraid to overtake because a car might come out?

Speaker 2: Exactly, so we just kept driving like that.

Speaker 1: And the road on your side was heavily occupied?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was. The car was driving in the middle of the lane.

Speaker 1: At that point, you felt it was far enough to the right, and you wanted to overtake it?

Speaker 2: Yes, I tried to overtake.

Speaker 1: But then you reached an intersection?

Speaker 2: Yes, and it blocked me again, so we continued like that for a while.

Speaker 1: I understand. This intersection didn't have traffic lights, which made it more complicated. Everyone was just moving as they pleased, leading to more minor collisions. Today, you needed to turn right first, and then... Oh, I see. You checked the left side for oncoming traffic. That's good. Then you checked the right side and back to the left. Got it.

Speaker 1: Did the car stay in front of you the whole time?

Speaker 2: Yes, it didn't move into the lane, which was frustrating. Once we passed that road, it was fine.

Speaker 1: And here, you could turn right on red?

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: At that moment, there were no non-motorized vehicles, so you didn't need to check the right side?

Speaker 2: Yes, there were no cars there.

Speaker 1: Why didn't you check for non-motorized vehicles on the right?

Speaker 2: Because it was a red light, and they wouldn't be moving.

Speaker 1: But they might turn or do something unexpected?

Speaker 2: No, there was a main road, and I entered the main lane directly.

Speaker 1: Oh, so you turned directly?

Speaker 2: Yes, and the side was clear.

Speaker 1: Understood. This section didn't have many vehicles. Do you have any driving habits that you think might be dangerous?

Speaker 2: I think I drive safely and don't have such habits.

Speaker 1: When you're a passenger, what driving habits of others make you feel nervous or unsafe?

Speaker 2: Sudden braking.

Speaker 1: Sudden braking?

Speaker 2: Yes, like when the light is already red, and they brake very close to the car in front instead of slowing down gradually.
Speaker 1: Sudden braking.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. Even when the light is already red, he waits until he's very close to the car in front before braking. He doesn't slow down gradually.

Speaker 1: Besides that, are there any other situations?

Speaker 2: Other than that, it's just the urgency. He tends to overtake cars frequently, even when it's not necessary. It looks very rushed.

Speaker 1: Can you recall any moments that made you feel particularly unsafe? Please share them.

Speaker 2: When the light is red, he gets very close to the car in front before braking. I rarely ride in other people's cars. Do you rarely ride in other people's cars? Yes, I usually drive myself. I understand. So, when you take a taxi, some drivers might... Yes, some drivers tend to curse and get impatient when other cars don't move. I find that quite unsafe. There's no need to be in such a hurry.

Speaker 1: I understand. Let's continue. Here, we have a right turn. Some drivers struggle to judge the road correctly, especially at this small and confusing intersection. I remember you had to check if it was the right turn and then slowly moved forward when you realized it wasn't.

Speaker 2: Yes, because there's a similar-looking turn just before it.

Speaker 1: It's not really a turn; it's more like a gate. Yes, exactly. How did you judge that this intersection was shorter?

Speaker 2: By looking at the map and seeing there was still some distance left, so I moved forward a bit more.

Speaker 1: When you drive, do you intentionally remember certain landmarks?

Speaker 2: Yes, like bus stops. I remember this intersection is just before a bus stop.

Speaker 1: Do you pay attention to the experience of other passengers in your car?

Speaker 2: The experience of people riding in my car? Yes, those riding in your car.

Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 2: I think their experience is generally good because I drive steadily and safely.

Speaker 1: Do you drive differently when you have passengers compared to when you're alone? Do you pay special attention to their comfort?

Speaker 2: Yes, I do consider it. For example, I adjust the air conditioning, windows, or speed to ensure they feel comfortable, especially if it's their first time riding with me.

Speaker 1: So, if someone is in your car, you consciously control these factors?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1: Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2: Occasionally, yes. For instance, if I'm in a hurry...
**Interviewer:** Do you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers feel uncomfortable?

**Driver:** Well, occasionally, yes. Sometimes, if I'm in a hurry, I might drive a bit faster than usual. I tend to accelerate quickly, but other than that, I think I'm okay.

**Interviewer:** When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors make you feel uncomfortable? Previously, I asked about feeling unsafe or nervous. This time, I'm asking about discomfort in general. What makes you feel uneasy when someone else is driving?

**Driver:** Mainly, it's when the driver keeps turning their head to talk to me.

**Interviewer:** That makes you feel uncomfortable?

**Driver:** Yes, very uncomfortable.

**Interviewer:** Besides talking to you or using their phone, what other driving behaviors make you uncomfortable?

**Driver:** For example, if the driver is talking on the phone while driving, it makes me uneasy. There was a time when I took a taxi, and the driver was on a call, talking to someone while driving. He would occasionally talk to me as well, which made me feel quite uncomfortable and unsafe.

**Interviewer:** So, it's the feeling of being unsafe that bothers you?

**Driver:** Yes, mainly the safety aspect. Other than that, things like the air conditioning might be a bit uncomfortable, but it's not a big deal.

**Interviewer:** During our study, we had two passengers with a handle that they could press if they felt uncomfortable. We recorded the data from those handles. Would you like to see the data later?

**Driver:** Yes, I'd like to see it.

**Interviewer:** Before you started driving, you knew that the passengers could press the handle if they felt uncomfortable. Did that make you pay special attention to certain aspects while driving?

**Driver:** Especially when looking to the right, sometimes the passenger's glasses or their position might block my view. They might also be trying to see the road conditions themselves, which can be distracting. I try to look ahead more to compensate.

**Interviewer:** So, when driving, do you pay more attention to the passengers' comfort or the road conditions?

**Driver:** I focus more on the road conditions and safety.

**Interviewer:** You're concerned about avoiding accidents?

**Driver:** Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: I am quite concerned about road conditions.

Speaker 2: Yes, safety on the road is very important.

Speaker 1: I am afraid of accidents. So, how do you feel about driving? Do you feel more comfortable now?

Speaker 2: Yes, whether it's decelerating or accelerating, it should be done smoothly and consistently.

Speaker 1: So, if we want to maintain a consistent speed, how should we control the vehicle?

Speaker 2: First, observe the other cars on the road. Keep a safe distance from them. If they are far away, gradually accelerate. If they are close, gradually decelerate. Always maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 1: Keeping a good distance is important. For example, when your vehicle transitions from a low speed to a high speed, like at a traffic light, how do you ensure a smooth start?

Speaker 2: In such situations, I don't worry about others. I only focus on maintaining a safe distance between my car and others.

Speaker 1: What about situations like turning or making a U-turn? How do you handle those?

Speaker 2: When turning, it's better to go slower to avoid too much inertia. For U-turns, the same principle applies.

Speaker 1: Understood. Let's continue watching the video.

Speaker 1: Was there any particular scene on the way back that left a strong impression on you?

Speaker 2: No, the return trip was smooth. There weren't many cars, and the lights were green.

Speaker 1: I want to ask you about a specific situation. There was a large vehicle parked there. We noticed you glanced at its front. Why did you do that?

Speaker 2: I wasn't sure if there was someone inside. The vehicle might suddenly turn without signaling.

Speaker 1: So, you were concerned about two things: someone stepping out from the front or the vehicle suddenly turning left.

Speaker 2: Yes, I was watching the driver's seat area to see if there were any signs of movement.

Speaker 1: I see. So, you weren't specifically worried about someone stepping out from a blind spot in front of the vehicle.

Speaker 2: At that moment, I slowed down a bit just in case someone appeared.

Speaker 1: Let's continue watching.

Speaker 1: Now, we're back at this entrance. It seems you were already observing the vehicles coming from the right.

Speaker 2: Yes, I saw someone crossing the road slowly.

Speaker 1: So, you were paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the road.
Speaker 1:
I was already observing the vehicles coming from the right.

Speaker 2:
I saw that person, but he wasn't looking at the other person; he was walking across the road.

Speaker 1:
So, he was actually slowly moving forward, and after you saw him stop, you roughly...

Speaker 2:
First, I looked at the person.

Speaker 1:
After looking at the person, what did you look at next? The car, right? You looked at the white car coming from the lane closest to you. Then you glanced at the vehicles coming from the right. Got it. This is the route we took back. If you feel the need to stop, we can discuss it at any point. The following questions might require some serious thought before you answer. The first question is, what do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver?

Speaker 2:
Well, first of all, they need to be stable. They can't be...

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by stable?

Speaker 2:
I mean, the driver's temperament should be calm. They shouldn't get easily frustrated, especially in traffic jams or difficult road conditions.

Speaker 1:
So, their emotions need to be stable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Road rage, for instance, isn't suitable for a driver. If they get angry as soon as there's a traffic jam, that's not good.

Speaker 1:
Besides emotional control, what other qualities do you think are important?

Speaker 2:
They need to follow the rules, especially traffic regulations. Observing pedestrians is crucial because they are vulnerable. Drivers should be very attentive to pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
So, they need to be observant of everything on the road, not just other vehicles.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. They should yield and not compete with others on the road.

Speaker 1:
Anything else you think makes a good or professional driver? For instance, have you ever driven a high-end car like a chauffeur? What distinguishes a good driver with decades of experience from an average driver?

Speaker 2:
First, their driving should be smooth, without sudden accelerations or decelerations. Also, I think drivers should avoid talking to passengers and focus on driving. Listening to music is fine, but chatting can be distracting.

Speaker 1:
What do you think is the difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?
Speaker 1: Listening to music is fine, but chatting with someone might be a bit distracting.

Speaker 2: Yes, I agree. So, what do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

Speaker 1: Experienced drivers don't get nervous easily. Even if they are driving on unfamiliar roads, they tend to stay calm.

Speaker 2: Why do you think they remain calm on unfamiliar roads?

Speaker 1: Because they have a certain level of driving experience. Even if they haven't been on a particular road before, they can estimate its width and conditions based on similar roads they've driven on. New drivers, on the other hand, tend to get nervous because they lack experience and familiarity.

Speaker 2: Besides the confidence that comes from experience, what other differences do you see between experienced and new drivers?

Speaker 1: Experienced drivers might not always follow the rules as strictly as new drivers.

Speaker 2: So, new drivers are more likely to follow the rules to the letter?

Speaker 1: Yes, exactly. Experienced drivers might know where the speed cameras are and might not slow down as much.

Speaker 2: Anything else?

Speaker 1: Not much else comes to mind.

Speaker 2: Here's a more challenging question: In what ways do you think autonomous driving will never be able to match human driving?

Speaker 1: Autonomous driving refers to the car driving itself, right? Sometimes the radar systems aren't very reliable. For example, Tesla has had incidents where the system detects obstacles that aren't there.

Speaker 2: So, you're referring to malfunctions or registration errors?

Speaker 1: Yes, exactly. And with electronic systems, you never know when they might fail.

Speaker 2: So, you think electronic systems are less reliable than traditional fuel-based systems?

Speaker 1: I believe so.

Speaker 2: Anything else? Excluding malfunctions or errors.

Speaker 1: Not necessarily benefits or drawbacks, just areas where autonomous systems can't match human capabilities.

Speaker 2: Well, it seems like technology is quite advanced, and there aren't many things that humans can do that machines can't.

Speaker 1: Not things humans can't do, but things machines can't do as well as humans. For example, areas where humans will always be superior.

Speaker 2: That's a tough question.

Speaker 1: Yes, it is a bit difficult to answer.

Speaker 2: It really is.

Speaker 1: Or you could think about what you do while driving that a machine might not be able to replicate.
Speaker 1:
Alright, let's start. Can you think about what you do while driving that you believe an autonomous car would never be able to do, or at least not as well as you?

Speaker 2:
That's a tough question.

Speaker 1:
Or maybe you can think about the things you pay attention to while driving that an autonomous car might not. What do you think?

Speaker 2:
Well, I think my driving habits are pretty well covered by modern electric cars, like radar scanning for pedestrians and sudden obstacles. They can handle those situations quite well. So, in that sense, I think they can do what I do.

Speaker 1:
So, apart from the occasional malfunction or instability compared to a human driver, you think they can handle most tasks? Alright, let's move on to the next question. How do you judge what pedestrians, non-electric vehicles, and other cars intend to do while you're driving? Let's start with pedestrians.

Speaker 2:
Pedestrians? I generally don't pay too much attention to where they're going as long as they don't step onto my main path.

Speaker 1:
How do you determine where they're going? It can be quite complex.

Speaker 2:
I look at their trajectory. When I pass by them, I definitely slow down to prevent any sudden movements.

Speaker 1:
Like turning or suddenly running forward?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I slow down and take a few extra seconds to judge their movements, just like when I was making that left turn earlier and saw someone looking at their phone.

Speaker 1:
Do you pay special attention to any specific behaviors of pedestrians?

Speaker 2:
What do you mean?

Speaker 1:
For example, with non-electric vehicles, you mentioned you look to see if the driver notices you. What about pedestrians? What do you look for?

Speaker 2:
I mainly look at where they're heading, their general direction.

Speaker 1:
How do you determine that? By their body orientation?

Speaker 2:
Yes, while driving, I can usually see their general path and trajectory.

Speaker 1:
And for non-electric vehicles, besides checking if the driver notices you, do you use any other methods to judge their intentions?

Speaker 2:
I mainly look at their distance and whether they notice me.

Speaker 1:
Apart from that, do you pay attention to anything else?

Speaker 2:
I also consider their speed, especially if they're on an electric bike. But mainly, I focus on whether they can see me.

Speaker 1:
So, you really pay attention to whether pedestrians and non-electric vehicle drivers notice you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
Person 2:
The main thing is whether they can see me or not.

Person 1:
So, you are very concerned about whether pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles can see you, right? What if they don't see you?

Person 2:
I might honk the horn.

Person 1:
You would honk to let them know you're there, and then you would proceed forward, right? After honking, would you feel more at ease to accelerate through?

Person 2:
No, I wouldn't accelerate. I would proceed slowly.

Person 1:
So, you wouldn't accelerate? The horn is just to alert them.

Person 2:
Yes, it's just to remind them.

Person 1:
You wouldn't change your speed or make any sudden moves; you would continue slowly.

Person 2:
Yes, I might occasionally go around if the road is wide enough, but that's rare.

Person 1:
Besides honking, do you use any other methods to signal your presence or your intention to pass?

Person 2:
At night, I might flash my lights. Other than that, just the horn and lights.

Person 1:
How do you judge the intentions of other vehicles? Many don't use their turn signals.

Person 2:
Before I turn, I usually observe for a while to see how they are moving, and then I signal.

Person 1:
So, you judge other vehicles' intentions based on their movement over a longer period. If they don't use turn signals, you observe more closely.

Person 2:
Yes, I don't just glance and go. I watch for a few seconds to see what they are doing.

Person 1:
In scenarios without traffic lights, if there's a pedestrian crossing, how do you decide whether to go first or let them go? For example, if the pedestrian doesn't stop.

Person 2:
I would definitely let them go first.

Person 1:
You would let them go first. If you see a pedestrian and they don't look at you, you would stop to let them pass.

Person 2:
Yes, if we both see each other and they don't move, I would go. If they keep walking, I would stop.

Person 1:
I understand. You would wait a few seconds to see their reaction.

Person 2:
Yes, I would slow down and see their reaction before deciding what to do.

Person 1:
Let me describe a scenario: both you and the pedestrian see each other and both want to give way. You both stop and wait for the other to move.
**Speaker 1:** For example, if you and a pedestrian both need to cross at the same time, and you both see each other, you both might try to give way to the other. So, you both stop, and then you both think, "Okay, I'll go," and you both start moving again at the same time.

**Speaker 2:** That usually doesn't happen. Typically, you just wave to signal. When you're in the car, the pedestrian can see you, so it works out. Generally, traffic rules state that cars should yield to pedestrians. It's not about competing for the right of way.

**Speaker 1:** Is it similar for non-motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's the same. They can start moving very quickly, even faster than pedestrians, so it's harder to react. You definitely need to yield to them; you can't compete with them.

**Speaker 1:** Because they start very quickly, if you both start at the same time, it's very easy to...

**Speaker 2:** ...collide. Yes, exactly. Delivery riders, for instance, are often in a hurry, so you need to be extra cautious around them.

**Speaker 1:** What about situations where you're at an intersection without traffic lights, or in places like Beijing where there are a lot of pedestrians crossing the street? Sometimes, they might just cross without looking.

**Speaker 2:** In those cases, you definitely need to yield.

**Speaker 1:** So, in such situations, would you proceed, or would you wait because there might be a group of people crossing, and once the first person crosses, everyone else follows, which could take a long time?

**Speaker 2:** If the light is green for me, I wouldn't yield because they should wait.

**Speaker 1:** But if there are no traffic lights?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if there are no lights, you should yield, no matter how many people there are. But if there are lights, you would expect them to yield to you.

**Speaker 1:** You can't be absolutely certain, though. Most of the time, you still need to check if they are walking slowly or speeding up. If they speed up, you have to yield to them.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Is there anything I missed?

**Speaker 2:** No, I think we covered everything. Let's finish watching this video. And then you can prepare the next part.

**Speaker 1:** Actually, there was an incident during a U-turn.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, during the U-turn at the intersection, a car was coming from the north, and we were both turning.

**Speaker 1:** So, he was turning right, and you were making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and then another car came from the front.

**Speaker 1:** Was it the black car?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was turning onto the same road, so I let it pass first.

**Speaker 1:** It can be quite scary, especially when non-motorized vehicles are going against traffic or coming from unexpected directions.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, no matter which direction they come from, it's always concerning.
Speaker 1: Are you afraid, for example, of vehicles coming at you from the wrong direction, either from the right or from the left?

Speaker 2: Yes, no matter which direction they come from, I am always cautious.

Speaker 1: How do you judge or maintain a safe distance from them? Many new drivers find it easier to manage the left side, but the right side is more challenging.

Speaker 2: I often keep an eye on the right side. 

Speaker 1: How do you usually control the distance on the right side of your car?

Speaker 2: With experience, I don't really think about it. I just have a sense of the distance. If there's enough space for both of us, I just go ahead.

Speaker 1: Can you give me specific time points from the video? For example, at 4:01. Do you need it down to the second?

Speaker 2: It's best if you can be precise, otherwise...

Speaker 1: It might be hard to pinpoint. So, the fourth minute of the video, right? Did they press the horn multiple times during that minute?

Speaker 2: Let me check the data.

Speaker 1: Can you open the filter for the fourth minute?

Speaker 2: Sure, here it is.

Speaker 1: Is this the co-driver's data?

Speaker 2: Yes, it's from the co-driver. 

Speaker 1: What do you think made the co-driver uncomfortable during the fourth minute? We can review that part of the video. At 4:09, it seems like something happened.

Speaker 2: Not exactly at 4:00. More like at 4:15 or 4:16.

Speaker 1: And at 4:42, right? If the co-driver pressed the horn, could it be because the car was too close to the right side?

Speaker 2: Yes, it might have been too close, making them uncomfortable.

Speaker 1: I see. Did the co-driver often look around or turn their head?

Speaker 2: Yes, especially when I was turning right. They would look around and sometimes even lean forward, blocking my view.

Speaker 1: Were there other instances when the horn was pressed? Maybe in the latter part of the fourth minute?

Speaker 2: Yes, at 4:42, there were two more presses.

Speaker 1: Can you check the data values for those instances? It seems like the co-driver pressed the horn intentionally.

Speaker 2: Yes, definitely. There might be a slight time difference, but it was around that time.

Speaker 1: Could it have been when you were making a U-turn and got too close to the flower bed?

Speaker 2: Yes, I might have brushed past the flower bed. The video should show that.

Speaker 1: Besides that part, what about the sixth minute of the video?

Speaker 2: At 6:29, there was another instance.
Speaker 1: Alright, besides this segment, there's also the part at the 6-minute mark in the video.

Speaker 2: 16 minutes out of 29 minutes.

Speaker 1: Anyway, it's definitely after the 6-minute mark.

Speaker 2: Good, this English is a bit off.

Speaker 1: Yes, it's a bit off. At the 6-minute mark, there's a vehicle coming from the right.

Speaker 2: Is there? No, look at the mirror.

Speaker 1: It's clear, there's no vehicle coming from the right when turning. Yes, I also checked the mirror, it's clear. Let's watch the entire 6 minutes again.

Speaker 2: At least watch until the 6-minute mark.

Speaker 1: Yes, because at the 6-minute and 30-second mark, you need to assume 01 is from 1 minute and 0 seconds. I understand your point. So, 01 could be 1 minute and 59 seconds, then you add 6 more minutes, and you'll know it's around 7 to 8 minutes.

Speaker 2: Maybe I accelerated here.

Speaker 1: Did you speed up here? On this road?

Speaker 2: Quite fast, I saw no cars, so I sped up.

Speaker 1: At which minute mark? Not sure about the next one. Just now it was around 5 minutes, right?

Speaker 2: The next one, you need to adjust the video to 9 minutes.

Speaker 1: 9 minutes. Okay, I'll adjust it directly.

Speaker 2: 47, you need to go to at least 9 minutes and 47 seconds.

Speaker 1: Okay, I'll go directly to 9:47.

Speaker 2: Yes, after 47 seconds, but within the next minute, it could appear.

Speaker 1: After 9:47?

Speaker 1: I think it's definitely not at this time, definitely not. It's after 47 plus 1 minute, so after 47 seconds.

Speaker 2: It could appear within a minute, but...

Speaker 1: Not sure if...

Speaker 1: The event doesn't have a specific time.

Speaker 1: He might think, where could it be? I think it's fine.

Speaker 2: It could appear before 47 seconds. There's nothing here. I might have accelerated a bit here.

Speaker 2: I'm fine with it, not sure about you?

Speaker 1: How long in total? 10 minutes? 3 and 14 days later, we watched this segment, the turn entrance, maybe different passengers have different feelings.

Speaker 2: Did the other person press anything?

Speaker 1: The other person didn't press anything.

Speaker 2: No. Maybe he felt differently on my side.

Speaker 1: You mean on the left side, I think.

Speaker 2: It's fine, you guys try it. 5% at this entrance.

Speaker 1: Did the sea cucumber make an offer? Some people might feel differently.

Speaker 2: Basically, the feeling is here.

Speaker 2: Actually, it's not too bad, five people.

Speaker 1: After that, there shouldn't be any more pressing. No. Alright, that's the end of our interview for today. Okay, I'll stop sharing now.

Speaker 2: Yes, and take this with you.
Speaker 1:
Alright, that should be everything for today’s interview. 

Speaker 2:
Yes, and you can take this with you.

Speaker 1:
Okay, I can take it off now. There’s just one more thing I need you to fill out.
