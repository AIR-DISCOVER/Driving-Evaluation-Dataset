**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
Is this the eye-tracking device you were wearing earlier, and can we see its recording? Let me adjust it a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
The red circle indicates where your gaze was focused at that moment. You entered the meeting, and we adjusted the 4D microphone. We are ready to start the formal interview.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you hear me now?

**Speaker 2:**
By default, the microphone should be set to the computer.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, this should be your computer's sound. Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker 2:**
I remember I need to unplug this for it to work properly.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, can you try speaking now?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Great, it seems to be working now. The sound might be a bit low, but it's fine. If everything is ready, we can start the interview. Before we begin, let me introduce myself. My name is Chang Xiang, and I will be conducting the final interview today. We will also watch the eye-tracking video recorded during the experiment to explore your driving habits. If you find anything interesting or if I need to ask you something, we can pause the video at any time. Feel free to speak up, and I will pause the video. I will ask you some specific questions, and you can answer them as you like. Don't be nervous; just treat it like a regular conversation. If there are any questions you don't want to answer, just let me know, and I won't press further. All the data from this meeting will be anonymized, and your personal information will not be disclosed. Let's start by playing the video here, and I will ask you some simple questions. For example, what types of cars have you driven before this experiment?

**Speaker 1:**
For instance, have you driven gasoline cars, electric cars, sedans, SUVs, or off-road vehicles? I haven't driven off-road vehicles, but I have driven sedans and SUVs. Only gasoline cars, no electric cars. Do any of the vehicles you have driven have driver assistance features like cruise control, lane-keeping, automatic start-stop, or active braking?

**Speaker 2:**
I haven't used those features.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they have those features, but you haven't tried them. Okay. Do you usually drive short distances or long distances in the city?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't drive much in the city, mostly long distances.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mostly drive long distances.
Speaker 1: Do you usually drive short distances or long distances in the city?

Speaker 2: I don't drive much in the city, mostly long distances.

Speaker 1: So you drive long distances more often. Is that for trips or other reasons? How far do you usually go?

Speaker 2: Typically, around 200 to 300 kilometers.

Speaker 1: Got it. How do you feel about driving our vehicle today?

Speaker 2: It's fine, pretty good.

Speaker 1: Are there any aspects of the vehicle that you find uncomfortable or that affect your driving? No? Okay. This might be a sensitive question, so feel free not to answer if you don't want to. Have you ever been involved in a traffic accident before? No? Alright, let's move on to the video.

Speaker 1: Here, we are making a right turn into the parking lot. Yes, this is a right turn. Later, when we enter the main test road and make another right turn, I'll ask you more detailed questions. Did the radar on the car beep? No? Okay, let's pause here. Can you tell me about your usual driving habits when making a turn?

Speaker 2: I usually check the surroundings first.

Speaker 1: Can you describe the details of how you observe the surroundings?

Speaker 2: First, I check for pedestrians, then I look at the lane I'm turning into to see if there are any cars. Basically, I look for people first, then cars.

Speaker 1: Where do you check for pedestrians?

Speaker 2: For example, I check the left side to see if anyone is walking towards the right.

Speaker 1: So you check if anyone is crossing the intersection?

Speaker 2: Yes, because my car has some blind spots, so I make it a habit to check the left side more carefully.

Speaker 1: Do you check the left side earlier in the process?

Speaker 2: Yes, I usually glance at the left side to assess the situation. If it's clear, I proceed.

Speaker 1: I understand. You use your peripheral vision to check, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, I use my peripheral vision.

Speaker 1: After checking the left side with your peripheral vision, what do you do next if there are no pedestrians?

Speaker 2: I then check for any oncoming cars.

Speaker 1: We're talking about making a right turn, correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, for a right turn, I check the left side for any oncoming cars.

Speaker 1: Understood. You check for oncoming traffic from the left side.
Speaker 1: When making a right turn, do you check for oncoming traffic from the left?

Speaker 2: Yes, I look for oncoming vehicles from the left.

Speaker 1: After checking for oncoming vehicles from the left, you then proceed to turn right?

Speaker 2: Yes, I make sure it's safe before turning.

Speaker 1: It seems you spend a considerable amount of time checking the left side.

Speaker 2: Yes, I double-check to ensure there are no pedestrians or other vehicles.

Speaker 1: So, you don't usually check the right side mirror when making a right turn?

Speaker 2: Not really, I rely on my peripheral vision for the right side.

Speaker 1: In this scenario, the car in front of you was blocking your way, and then the road cleared. You were entering a main road from a side road. Can you describe your usual habit when merging from a side road to a main road?

Speaker 2: If the side road is long, I signal three times, move to the position just behind where the taxi was, and then check the left lane for cars before proceeding. I straighten the car a bit first.

Speaker 1: So, you use the middle buffer area to straighten the car before merging left?

Speaker 2: Yes, because if the car is angled, it's hard to see the left rearview mirror. I don't usually turn my head to check.

Speaker 1: You rely on the left rearview mirror to check for cars behind you, correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, I prefer to keep the car straight in the buffer area so I can see the rearview mirror clearly.

Speaker 1: Understood. Now, when driving straight on a clear road, what speed do you usually maintain? For example, if the speed limit is 60 km/h, what speed do you typically drive at?

Speaker 2: If there are no cars, I drive at 60 km/h.

Speaker 1: Do you ever exceed the speed limit?

Speaker 2: Sometimes, but only by a small margin, like up to 65 km/h, which is within 10% over the limit.
Speaker 1:
So, you usually drive at 60 km/h?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if there are no cars around.

Speaker 1:
Do you sometimes go a bit over the limit?

Speaker 2:
Yes, sometimes a little over, like up to 65 km/h, which is within 10% over the limit. But what about driving on the Third or Fourth Ring Roads? Do you drive there often?

Speaker 1:
Those roads are usually quite congested.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the Third and Fourth Ring Roads are often busy.

Speaker 1:
If there are no cars, and the speed limit is 80 km/h, do you usually stick to that limit or go a bit over?

Speaker 2:
I might go a bit over, but I generally try to maintain a safe distance from other cars.

Speaker 1:
What kind of distance do you usually keep?

Speaker 2:
I tend to keep a bit more distance, especially since I often drive on highways.

Speaker 1:
By highways, you mean those with a speed limit of 100 km/h?

Speaker 2:
Yes, highways with a 100 km/h limit.

Speaker 1:
Or even 120 km/h. On those highways, there are signs indicating 50 meters, 100 meters, and 150 meters to help judge the distance. What distance do you usually maintain?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the speed. If I'm driving at 120 km/h, I might keep a distance of about 75 to 100 meters.

Speaker 1:
And on regular roads like today, how far do you usually keep from the car in front?

Speaker 2:
I don't have a specific distance, but I adjust based on the situation. I try to keep a distance that feels comfortable and safe.

Speaker 1:
So, at 60 km/h, what distance do you think is appropriate?

Speaker 2:
Around 10 to 15 meters, about two car lengths.

Speaker 1:
Alright, and when making a U-turn on a narrow road, what is your usual approach?

Speaker 2:
On narrow roads, I might not be able to make the turn in one go. I usually check if there are any cars on the right. If there are no cars and the light is green, I will turn without much hesitation. I might steer a bit to the right first to give myself more space for the U-turn.

Speaker 1:
So, you first check the right side?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if the road is narrow, I need to steer a bit to the right first. I check if there are any cars on the right side.

Speaker 1:
You steer to the right to create more space for the turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If there are no cars on the right, I can make the turn more easily. I also check the opposite side for any oncoming buses or cars. If the light is red, I might not check as thoroughly, but if it's green, I make sure to look.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, the first thing you do at a narrow U-turn is to check the right side for any cars. If it's clear, you steer a bit to the right to give yourself more space for the turn.
Speaker 1:
At the U-turn entrance, you need to first check if there are any cars on your right. If there are no cars, you should turn the steering wheel slightly to the right to give yourself more space for the U-turn. After that, you need to check if the traffic light is red or green. If it's red and there are no oncoming cars, you can make the U-turn in one go. Today, it seemed like you didn't turn the wheel to the right.

Speaker 2:
I did turn the wheel a bit to the right, just a little.

Speaker 1:
Yes, your hand did move to the right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it did. I moved it slightly.

Speaker 1:
Your hand was off the center axis. How do you determine if you can make the U-turn in one go safely? I remember the first time you test-drove, you made the U-turn in one go. But the second time, you had to reverse a bit.

Speaker 2:
The second time, there was a car on the right, so I didn't turn as much.

Speaker 1:
I see. So, during the actual test, you made the U-turn in one go.

Speaker 2:
Yes, in one go.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge the distance to ensure the car's front won't hit the curb? Do you have any reference points?

Speaker 2:
No, I don't have any specific reference points. It's just a long straight road. 

Speaker 1:
Alright, let me ask you some other questions to ensure safe driving. Are there any particular areas you pay extra attention to while driving?

Speaker 2:
Not really, no.

Speaker 1:
Is there anything you think could make driving safer based on your experience today?

Speaker 2:
I don't drive much in the city, but I think the main thing is to watch out for pedestrians. Sometimes, you can't predict what they will do. For example, there was a cyclist who seemed like he might turn left, but I thought he would go right. So, I had to adjust my steering. You really need to watch people because their actions can be unpredictable.

Speaker 1:
So, your predictions about pedestrians' actions can sometimes be wrong.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. It happened on the side road when we were coming back after the U-turn.

Speaker 1:
Got it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember approximately where the incident occurred?

Speaker 2: It happened just now on the auxiliary road. I had already turned around and was heading back.

Speaker 1: Oh, you had already turned around and were preparing to enter the parking lot from the auxiliary road? Okay, let's check if the eye-tracking device is still recording, because sometimes it stops when you turn around. Oh, okay. And here, you made a right turn and entered our figure-eight course. I wanted to ask if you could observe the situation on the auxiliary road from your right rearview mirror at that time?

Speaker 2: I didn't check, haha. I don't think I looked at it.

Speaker 1: So, you didn't check if there were any planes, trains, other vehicles, or pedestrians on the auxiliary road?

Speaker 2: Right, because it felt quite empty at the time, so I didn't look.

Speaker 1: Indeed, the quality check shows you didn't look. Do you usually drive like this, similar to today?

Speaker 2: Actually, I rarely drive in crowded places.

Speaker 1: There's another right turn ahead. Let's continue to observe. Okay.

Speaker 2: Generally, when I'm on the road, I check for pedestrians because they are slower than cars. So, I usually look for people on the road, and if there are none, I don't check further.

Speaker 1: So, before you reach an intersection, you look to the right in advance?

Speaker 2: Yes, when driving, you can see the right side clearly.

Speaker 1: If there are people there, you would see them in advance?

Speaker 2: Yes, if there are no people, I don't check when passing the intersection.

Speaker 1: Do you also check after parking?

Speaker 2: Yes, I do.

Speaker 1: How do you determine if a non-motorized vehicle is stationary? Do you think it won't move and cause a conflict with your route?

Speaker 2: I can see it directly in front of me when turning.

Speaker 1: During the second phase of the experiment, did you perform any lane changes or overtaking?

Speaker 2: No, I didn't.

Speaker 1: Can you describe your lane-changing and overtaking habits? We are only asking about your habits since we can't recreate the exact scenario.

Speaker 2: I don't do it often, haha.

Speaker 1: You mentioned you drive more on highways, so you must change lanes and overtake there.

Speaker 2: Yes, usually on the far-left lane. On highways with three or more lanes, I move to the second lane from the left and accelerate. I first check if there are any cars on the right, and if there aren't, I change lanes and overtake.
Speaker 1:
Oh, I see. So, you usually drive in the leftmost lane, and when you need to overtake, you have to move to the right lane. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's right. When I need to overtake, I move to the right lane. 

Speaker 1:
Got it. Can you describe the process in more detail? For example, after you move to the right lane, you still need to observe the traffic in the left lane before moving back. Can you describe this observation process in more detail, perhaps with a specific scenario?

Speaker 2:
OK. After I move to the right lane, I usually accelerate to ensure I can overtake the car in the left lane. On the highway, I might overtake by about 20 or 30 meters before moving back. When moving back, I check the left rearview mirror and the left side to ensure it's safe before merging back.

Speaker 1:
In the video, there's a non-motorized vehicle that entered your original lane. You chose to move to the left to avoid it. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I moved to the left to avoid it.

Speaker 1:
And there's a school ahead. Did you notice it?

Speaker 2:
No, I didn't.

Speaker 1:
No problem. Do you usually pay attention to such things when driving?

Speaker 2:
Not very often, but occasionally.

Speaker 1:
Let's talk about making a left turn. Can you describe your driving habits when making a left turn?

Speaker 2:
When making a left turn, I first check the right side for pedestrians and vehicles.

Speaker 1:
You check for both pedestrians and vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I check for both.

Speaker 1:
And then?

Speaker 2:
As I move forward, I also check the left side for any oncoming traffic or pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
Do you also check for vehicles making a right turn or going straight?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I check for those as well.

Speaker 1:
So, you first check the right side, then the left side, and adjust your distance accordingly. In this scenario, there's a vehicle blocking your path, so you treat it as a meeting situation, even though you're the only car moving. How do you judge the distance between your car and obstacles on both sides?

Speaker 2:
I rely on my intuition.

Speaker 1:
Do you prefer to be closer to one side or the other?

Speaker 2:
I usually stay closer to the left side.

Speaker 1:
In this situation, a bicycle appears, and you both can't pass simultaneously because of the limited space. How do you handle it?
Speaker 1:
At this moment, a bicycle came out, and you both couldn't pass at the same time because of the obstacles. How did you decide whether to let the cyclist go first or go yourself?

Speaker 2:
Let me think.

Speaker 1:
Do you remember what happened then?

Speaker 2:
Usually, the cyclist would let me go first. In such situations, they would typically wait at the gap.

Speaker 1:
So, they would wait at the gap until you passed?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because they couldn't go through on the left side either.

Speaker 1:
I see.

Speaker 2:
But you can't always be sure if they will let you go. In such cases, I usually slow down and brake a bit to see their reaction. Most of the time, they let me go.

Speaker 1:
So, there's a high probability that they will let you go.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but even if they don't, I can still pass if they move inside without stopping.

Speaker 1:
Now, at this left turn, there was a white car blocking the way.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I had to move forward a bit more to make the turn.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, there were two pedestrians preparing to cross the street. How did you decide whether to turn left first or let them cross?

Speaker 2:
I remember one of them, either the mother or the child, stepped back a bit initially.

Speaker 1:
Yes, they seemed to be moving forward at first.

Speaker 2:
They were still quite far away when they stepped back.

Speaker 1:
But they continued to move forward afterward.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they did.

Speaker 1:
So, you observed their movements to determine their intentions?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I watched to see if they stepped back or showed any signs of yielding.

Speaker 1:
You mentioned that sometimes you misjudge the situation. What kind of scenarios lead to that?

Speaker 2:
For example, they might stop and then suddenly start walking again.

Speaker 1:
They stop and then suddenly move forward?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they might think they can cross and then run a few steps.

Speaker 1:
They pause, assess the situation, and then suddenly speed up to cross. What do you do in such cases?

Speaker 2:
I brake.

Speaker 1:
Do you brake hard?

Speaker 2:
Not necessarily hard, just enough to slow down.

Speaker 1:
Because you might have anticipated that they would let you go, you might have sped up a bit?

Speaker 2:
No, I usually just proceed at a normal speed.
**Speaker 1:** How do you judge if the pedestrian might let you pass, and what do you do next? Do you speed up or...?

**Speaker 2:** I don't usually speed up. I just maintain a normal speed. In such situations, pedestrians generally have their own judgment about the speed of the vehicle. They won't do anything too risky because no one wants to get hit. If they decide to speed up, it's because they believe they can cross safely. So, if I just slow down a bit, it shouldn't create any traffic danger.

**Speaker 1:** So, you just gradually slow down and don't hit the brakes hard unless the pedestrian is very close?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Unless they are very close, but in such cases, pedestrians usually won't speed up to cross.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. Are there any situations while driving that particularly scare you? Can you describe them?

**Speaker 2:** I'm often scared when driving on highways, especially at night. Dead animals or plastic bags on the road can be frightening.

**Speaker 1:** You mean other objects on the road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Since I drive at night a lot, sometimes the high beams don't help much, and it's hard to identify what those objects are in time, which can be quite dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Do you try to avoid them by steering or just slow down?

**Speaker 2:** I usually don't steer to avoid them. I either drive over them or slow down.

**Speaker 1:** Besides these scenarios, are there any other situations that you find particularly frightening?

**Speaker 2:** Not really.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might lead to danger?

**Speaker 2:** Possibly. I'm not very familiar with traffic rules. Even though I passed the written test, sometimes I'm unsure. For example, after my first test drive, I wasn't sure if I could make a U-turn at a green light.

**Speaker 1:** At a green light?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I wasn't sure if I could make a U-turn at a green light or if I needed to wait for a red light. I asked a friend to confirm.

**Speaker 1:** Did you ask on your phone?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I asked my friend after I had already made the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, after the test drive?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, during the test drive, the light was green, so I made the turn. I asked my friend afterward to confirm.

**Speaker 1:** And what did your friend say?

**Speaker 2:** He said it was okay. I used to drive more abroad, and since I got my license a long time ago, I'm not always sure about the local rules. If I'm uncertain, I prefer to wait rather than take a risk.

**Speaker 1:** Besides not being familiar with traffic rules, are there any other driving habits you think might be dangerous?
Speaker 1:
Instead of turning, it's better to wait a bit.

Speaker 1:
Yes, besides being unfamiliar with traffic rules, what other driving habits do you think might lead to danger?

Speaker 2:
I think sometimes I might lack safety awareness. For example, people who sit in the passenger seat, like family members, might feel that I drive a bit aggressively and fast.

Speaker 1:
When you are a passenger in someone else's car, what kind of driving behavior makes you feel nervous or unsafe?

Speaker 2:
Unsafe?

Speaker 1:
Yes, unsafe. Let's continue watching our video.

Speaker 1:
At that time, the taxi on the right, its trajectory wasn't very stable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it wasn't very stable. It was swaying a bit.

Speaker 1:
So how did you judge whether it would change lanes? Because there was a bus in front of it blocking the view, and it could have changed lanes to the left at any moment. How did you assess this situation?

Speaker 2:
First, I thought I could pass before it reached the van. Second, I wasn't entirely on the right side of the road; I was slightly to the left.

Speaker 1:
Yes, you were slightly to the left.

Speaker 2:
So I had already given it some space to pass. Even if we reached the van at the same time, I would have given it enough room to get through.

Speaker 1:
I understand. I wanted to ask you more about this because this situation didn't occur during the formal experiment. Do you remember during the test drive, after passing the blue bus, two electric bikes suddenly appeared?

Speaker 2:
I don't quite remember that.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, you had no visibility of the right side of the road because it was completely blocked. What was your judgment at that time?

Speaker 2:
The speed on that road wasn't very fast, so any sudden situation on the right could be handled with braking. The speed was around 40 km/h, so it was quite slow.

Speaker 1:
So you felt that even if someone or something suddenly appeared, you could stop in time with a brake?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1:
Ahead, there is an intersection without traffic lights, which is an important scenario in our experiment. Let's take a closer look at the situation. Why didn't you check the left side of the road when you made the right turn this time?

Speaker 2:
Because the car in front...
**Speaker 1:**
Let's take a closer look at the situation. Why didn't you check the road to the left when you made that right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Because the car in front of me was turning left.

**Speaker 1:**
So you felt it could block the traffic for you, right? I see. And you mentioned that you rarely check the right side mirror when making a right turn. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because on roads like this, the turns aren't very fast, so I usually don't check the right side mirror. If the speed were higher, I would definitely check it.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Now, in this right turn scenario, there are more people and cars. Why didn't you check the left side for road conditions and vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
It seemed like the light was red.

**Speaker 1:**
Right. In situations where there are many cars and people on the right, do you check the right side mirror or look through the passenger window?

**Speaker 2:**
Not me, but I do glance quickly to scan the area.

**Speaker 1:**
In crowded scenarios like this, do you feel more pressure or get nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
What strategy do you usually use to navigate through such traffic conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
I tend to slow down a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Right.

**Speaker 2:**
I make sure there are no cars ahead, and during our first test drive, there were many people and cars. I waited until most of the pedestrians had crossed and ensured there were no cars behind me before making the right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
I remember that it was a red light, but you could still turn right, correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but the left side had a green light, so there were many vehicles and bicycles passing through. At that time, about 3-4 cars went by, and then a bus stopped, so I made the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Now, on this straight and open stretch, I have a few more questions. Do you usually consider the passengers' experience while driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, because when I'm driving, it's usually just me, and sometimes the passenger is asleep.

**Speaker 1:**
So, typically on highways, it's just you and someone else sleeping?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's usually just me and my boyfriend. Either he drives while I sleep, or I drive while he sleeps.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you feel different when driving with family members or people you're not very familiar with compared to driving alone?

**Speaker 2:**
We have a...
**Speaker 1:**
When you're driving with someone familiar, do you feel different compared to when you're driving alone?

**Speaker 2:**
We have a dog. Does that count? I pay a lot of attention to the dog's condition.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when the dog is in the car, you are more concerned about its well-being. Does that change your driving habits or make you pay special attention to certain situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the dog seems uncomfortable, I will slow down or even stop the car.

**Speaker 1:**
You're worried about the dog getting car sick?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, either that or it might need to go to the bathroom. If it needs to go to the bathroom, I call my boyfriend. If the dog is car sick, I handle it differently.

**Speaker 1:**
When other people are in your car, do you pay special attention to their comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any of your driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I'm okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's continue.

**Speaker 2:**
My mom always thinks my driving is dangerous. Family members tend to worry more, and it's very obvious.

**Speaker 1:**
Do they think your driving style or habits are unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they do.

**Speaker 1:**
Have they mentioned specific things you do that they find unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, like braking early when there's a car in front. They always have something to say.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they think you follow the car in front too closely?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and they also mention not to accelerate too quickly. They don't usually comment on braking, but they want me to react faster. Everyone just seems unnecessarily tense.

**Speaker 1:**
When you ride in someone else's car or take a taxi, what kind of driver behavior makes you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
If the car sways too much from side to side, I get car sick.

**Speaker 1:**
When does the car sway from side to side?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, when the driver isn't steady, they might veer left and then overcorrect to the right, making the car sway. It's hard to stay in a straight line, and it feels like the car is moving in a long 'S' shape. 

**Speaker 1:**
Are there other situations that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden starts and stops.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean at traffic lights, when the light turns green and the driver accelerates too hard?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1:
Hello, Jiting.

Speaker 2:
Hello.

Speaker 1:
When you mentioned "quick start" and "quick stop," you were referring to traffic lights, right? So, when the light turns green, you accelerate hard. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's right. It means the braking distance is quite short.

Speaker 1:
And "quick stop" means slamming on the brakes. Is there anything else that makes you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
No, that's about it.

Speaker 1:
Okay, so the passengers in the car have handles they can hold onto when they feel uncomfortable. Are you aware of this?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I know about that.

Speaker 1:
Given that you know this, would you make any special efforts during this experiment to ensure they feel more comfortable, like paying extra attention to certain things or using additional skills?

Speaker 2:
Not really, no.

Speaker 1:
Alright. How do you think you can drive in a way that makes passengers feel more comfortable?

Speaker 2:
Probably by avoiding the things I mentioned that make me uncomfortable when others drive.

Speaker 1:
So, you would pay attention to those points to avoid making others uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
Let's continue watching this video. In previous experiments, drivers often took the wrong turn at this bend. How did you determine which intersection to turn right at on this road?

Speaker 2:
I grew up in this area, so I know there's a basketball court east of the bus stop. After passing the basketball court, you turn right at the first green light.

Speaker 1:
So, you're familiar with this area, right? How do you judge the distance between your car and the one on your left? From our perspective, it looked like you were about to collide.

Speaker 2:
No, I felt the distance was still quite far. I did steer a bit to the right to avoid them.

Speaker 1:
What floor are we on now?

Speaker 2:
This is the 11th floor, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, the 11th floor. This part of the conversation might be a bit challenging. What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

Speaker 2:
A professional driver should first ensure the safety of both the car and the passengers. That's very important. Secondly...

Speaker 1:
Let's pause for a moment. To ensure safety, what do you think drivers should do?

Speaker 2:
Well, there's a saying that goes...
**Speaker 1:**
Let's wait a moment. I just want to ask, to ensure safety, what do you think they should do?

**Speaker 2:**
There's a saying, "Eyes on the road, ears on the surroundings." They need to be very attentive.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, they need to be more attentive. Anything else to ensure safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Speed is a big issue. High speeds often lead to accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think they should maintain their speed within a controllable range?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, within a range they can control. Any other requirements?

**Speaker 2:**
They shouldn't drive emotionally.

**Speaker 1:**
Like road rage or similar behaviors?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. Are there other requirements for professional or good drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
They should also ensure their own health, avoiding driving when they have medical conditions or are overly fatigued.

**Speaker 1:**
Where do you think the biggest difference lies between experienced and novice drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Handling unexpected situations. Experienced drivers rely on their instincts, while novices tend to be overly cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, being overly cautious in judging the distance between cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. My friend is outside; can you help them? Yes, sure. Alright, anything else?

**Speaker 1:**
When talking about professional and good drivers, besides safety, what else should they focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
I think that's about it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you believe that as long as professional drivers ensure the safety of passengers and the vehicle, that's enough?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's the basic requirement. Comfort is more subjective.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate on what you mean by subjective?

**Speaker 2:**
Some people care more about comfort, so they drive more smoothly. For example, I care about comfort, so I brake and accelerate gently.

**Speaker 1:**
So, because you care about comfort when you're a passenger, you also focus on it when you drive. The next question might be a bit challenging. In what aspects do you think autonomous cars can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Morality. Autonomous cars might face moral dilemmas.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's focus on driving aspects. For example, when you drive, do you think...
Speaker 1:
Let's focus on driving. For example, when you drive, what aspects do you pay attention to, or what actions do you take that an autonomous vehicle could never replicate?

Speaker 2:
Judging pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
Judging pedestrians, yes. As you mentioned earlier, it's difficult to predict the intentions of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles, and it's easy to make mistakes. So, as a human driver, you find it challenging to judge these intentions, making it even harder for autonomous vehicles. How do you usually judge the intentions of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles while driving? Besides specific actions like noticing a pedestrian stepping back to let you pass, are there other behaviors that help you better understand their intentions?

Speaker 2:
For pedestrians, it's mainly about whether they will yield to you.

Speaker 1:
So, you observe if they will actively avoid you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I usually slow down when I see someone and then check if they will yield.

Speaker 1:
What about non-motorized vehicles? For instance, we saw one earlier that might have been about to turn left.

Speaker 2:
I would give way in advance.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge their behavior, rather than just avoiding them? How do you understand their intentions?

Speaker 2:
If they show a clear intention to turn left, I will yield.

Speaker 1:
And if they don't?

Speaker 2:
I will keep a closer eye on them.

Speaker 1:
Keeping a closer eye means?

Speaker 2:
When they are parallel to me, I will constantly monitor them to see if they suddenly change direction or speed up.

Speaker 1:
What about motorized vehicles? Besides obvious signals like turn indicators, how do you judge their intentions?

Speaker 2:
By looking at the front wheels.

Speaker 1:
The front wheels, to see if they are turning?

Speaker 2:
Yes, to see if they are turning. Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Speed, mostly by intuition.

Speaker 1:
Let's continue. In the video of you driving, you were making a left turn at an intersection without traffic lights. You first observed the oncoming traffic from the right. When you made the left turn, what were you looking at?

Speaker 2:
The left side.
Speaker 1: I noticed that you first observed the cars coming from the right side. When you were about to make a left turn, what were you looking at?

Speaker 2: I was looking to the left because it's a two-way street. I was checking for any oncoming cars.

Speaker 1: Were you checking for any cars going straight or coming from the right side?

Speaker 2: Yes, but turning right doesn't really affect me much. Most of the time, I focus on going straight.

Speaker 1: I see. So, when you make a left turn, you usually check the right side first, even if it's a bit farther away. Is that correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's right. When I make a left turn, I pay attention to the left rearview mirror.

Speaker 1: I noticed you were looking at the blue car. Is that correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.

Speaker 1: Okay, now we're almost back to the parking lot. I have one last question. Imagine a scenario where you're at an intersection without traffic lights, and a pedestrian is about to cross the street. You also need to pass through the intersection, but you're unsure if the pedestrian will let you go first or if they will stop. How would you handle this situation?

Speaker 2: I would stop and let the pedestrian cross first.

Speaker 1: What if you stop and the pedestrian also stops, unsure if you will go first? Would you signal them to go ahead?

Speaker 2: Yes, I would signal them to go ahead. I wouldn't accelerate or try to pass quickly. I prefer to wait and ensure they cross safely.

Speaker 1: Earlier, when you saw the mother and her little girl at the intersection, why did you proceed when the girl stepped back?

Speaker 2: I slowed down because I was cautious. I wanted to make sure the child wouldn't suddenly run across the street. When I saw them stop, I felt it was safe to proceed.

Speaker 1: So, you slowed down to ensure the child wouldn't make any sudden moves?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. I wanted to be sure the child wouldn't suddenly dart across the street. You can never be too sure with children.
Speaker 1:
To ensure that the child doesn't suddenly dash across the road, because you can't predict what a child might do. So, you slowed down to prepare for any sudden situations, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I slowed down so that if the child suddenly ran out, I could stop immediately. It's not about yielding to let the child pass, but rather to reduce the likelihood of an accident.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Shall we continue watching the video?

Speaker 2:
Sure.

Speaker 1:
Next, you made a right turn onto the main road.

Speaker 1:
As you mentioned, you were cautious about the right turn and paid attention to the left side of the road. When you turned right, you moved into the middle lane. What was your reasoning?

Speaker 2:
I've driven on this road before, and I know that I need to move left because there's a bus stop ahead.

Speaker 1:
So, you initially moved to the rightmost lane and then planned to shift left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1:
I noticed that when you changed lanes to the left, you didn't check the left side mirror.

Speaker 2:
I did glance at it.

Speaker 1:
It wasn't captured clearly on the recording.

Speaker 2:
Really? It was recorded, but maybe not very clearly.

Speaker 1:
Perhaps it was too quick for the camera to catch.

Speaker 2:
I did glance quickly.

Speaker 1:
So, it might have been too fast for the camera to capture.

Speaker 2:
Maybe I blinked when I glanced, so it wasn't recorded.

Speaker 1:
When you turned back, you mentioned there was a bicycle on the side road, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1:
I noticed that when a vehicle was very close to you, how did you judge that it wouldn't hit you from the right side? I didn't see you looking.

Speaker 2:
I probably saw it with my peripheral vision and felt that there was enough space. It wasn't as close as it seemed on the video.

Speaker 1:
Is this the bicycle you mentioned?

Speaker 2:
I think so, but I'm not entirely sure. Yes, that's it. I moved slightly to the left.

Speaker 1:
You also braked to let it pass.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I braked to let it pass because it was blocked by the road barrier.

Speaker 1:
So, you waited for it to pass before you continued.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I wasn't in a hurry.

Speaker 1:
At this point, there was also an oncoming vehicle driving in the wrong direction.
Speaker 1: For example, did you honk the horn or do anything like that? I'm not quite sure.

Speaker 2: I was in a hurry, haha.

Speaker 1: Okay, at that moment, there was oncoming traffic, right? Yes, there was a vehicle driving in the wrong direction. I felt it was really close just now.

Speaker 1: Then I accelerated to overtake them quickly and made a turn. Do you remember that?

Speaker 2: I didn't accelerate.

Speaker 1: Normally, our linked video ends here. Since you mentioned you didn't want to see the passenger's handle data due to some issues, we won't show it to you. Alright, I don't have any additional questions. Do you have any questions or anything to add? If not, our experiment is over. There's a form you need to fill out. Oh, I might have forgotten to ask you earlier, do you remember what time you had lunch today? 11:35. Before the experiment, did you have any coffee or smoke? No. Okay.

Speaker 2: Do you have your bank card with you?

Speaker 1: You can take off the microphone now. We're stopping the recording.
