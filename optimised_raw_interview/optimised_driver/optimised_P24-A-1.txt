**Interviewer:**
Hello, I'm testing this microphone. Can you say something to check the sound?

**Interviewee:**
Hello, the light is on, so it should be working fine. I think the microphone quality is good. Let's test it closer to the source.

**Interviewer:**
Hello, can you hear me? Is the sound clear?

**Interviewee:**
Yes, I can hear you clearly. There is a bit of an echo, but it's not a problem.

**Interviewer:**
Great, let's proceed. I'll introduce myself. My name is Chang Xiang, and I'll be conducting this interview. We'll watch a video recorded from the panoramic camera on the car roof and discuss your driving habits. If there's anything interesting, we can pause and discuss it.

**Interviewer:**
I'll ask you some specific questions. Just answer as you would in a normal conversation. If any question feels too sensitive, you can choose not to answer. All collected data will be anonymized, so you don't need to worry about privacy.

**Interviewer:**
Let's start with some simple questions. What types of cars have you driven before?

**Interviewee:**
I've driven two types of cars at home. The first was a Buick Excelle, and later we switched to a Honda CR-V.

**Interviewer:**
So, one is an SUV and the other is a sedan?

**Interviewee:**
Yes, the CR-V is an SUV, and the Excelle is a sedan.

**Interviewer:**
Do these cars have any driver assistance features?

**Interviewee:**
Yes, but I haven't used them.

**Interviewer:**
Can you tell me what features they have?

**Interviewee:**
For example, there's a lane departure warning system that alerts you if you drift out of your lane.

**Interviewer:**
Does it help keep the car centered in the lane?

**Interviewee:**
Yes, it alerts you if you're not in the center of the lane, and it can assist with minor steering adjustments.
Speaker 1: So, it will alert you, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, it will. If you're not staying in the middle of the lane, it will alert you. And if you start to drift a bit, it can forcibly steer the wheel back for you.

Speaker 1: Right, that's lane-keeping assist.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1: Are there any other features?

Speaker 2: There should be other features, but I rarely use them.

Speaker 1: I see. Do you often drive short distances or long distances in the city?

Speaker 2: In my daily life, I mostly drive short distances. However, based on my driving frequency, it's about the same. I only drive when I go home, which is often long distances, especially during major holidays.

Speaker 1: Your home is in Tianjin, so you drive from Beijing to Tianjin?

Speaker 2: Usually, my dad drives from Tianjin to pick me up, and then I drive back. When I go to school, I drive back to Beijing, and my dad drives back to Tianjin. During holidays, we drive to our hometown in Hengshui, Hebei. I drive both ways.

Speaker 1: So, within Beijing, you mostly drive from the airport highway to Tsinghua University?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1: So, you don't drive much within the city of Beijing on a daily basis?

Speaker 2: No, I don't have a daily commuting need. During the pandemic, I drove from Tianjin to Beijing's Second Ring Road to visit the Children's Hospital and then drove around the city, including a visit to the Summer Palace. That was one of the few times I drove extensively within the city. Usually, I drive on the outer ring roads.

Speaker 1: I see. How did you feel driving our car today? Did being unfamiliar with the car or it being a sedan affect your driving?

Speaker 2: At first, I felt a bit awkward since I had never driven a car other than my family's. During the test drive, I felt a bit stiff and uncomfortable. But by the second time, I felt much more comfortable and could adapt to its length and turning radius.

Speaker 1: So, was there a noticeable difference compared to your usual driving?

Speaker 2: By the second round, there was no noticeable difference in how it felt.

Speaker 1: So, you're not sure if there was any difference in your actual driving behavior?

Speaker 2: Correct, I didn't notice any difference in my driving behavior.
**Speaker 1:**
So, have you noticed any specific differences in your driving behavior?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not sure because when I drive, I don't really pay attention to that.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let me ask you, have you ever been involved in a traffic accident?

**Speaker 2:**
No, never. In the past three years, I haven't had any accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, the following questions will focus on your driving habits. For example, when you encounter situations like turning or making a U-turn, I will ask about your usual driving habits. Then, we will watch a video segment to see if your behavior matches your usual habits. If there are discrepancies, we will discuss the reasons. Let's start with a right turn onto a side road. Can you describe your usual driving habits when making a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, when making a right turn, I always signal in advance, then observe the traffic. If there are no issues, I proceed with the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Great, we would like you to be more detailed in your descriptions. For instance, when you mentioned observing, could you specify what you observe first, then next? Do you look through the front windshield, side windows, or mirrors? What are the key things you focus on outside the car? Are you looking for pedestrians, vehicles, or other objects?

**Speaker 2:**
When making a right turn, I first look through the front windshield and the left side window to check the traffic on the left side of the lane I am entering. 

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by the left side of the lane?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean the left side of the lane I am about to enter, which is the right side of my current lane.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you are referring to the left side of the lane you are turning into?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. I first check for any oncoming traffic on the left side of the lane I am entering. I mainly look for pedestrians and vehicles, especially delivery scooters.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you consider electric scooters as pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't treat them as pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you categorize non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians separately?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, after ensuring there are no hazards, what do you do next?

**Speaker 2:**
After confirming there are no dangers, I check the right side mirror to ensure it's safe to proceed.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you mentioned pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles. Alright, good.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I first make sure there are no dangerous situations. Then, I use the right-side mirror to check if there are any pedestrians or non-motorized vehicles on my right side before turning. They might not pay attention to whether you have signaled or not. In the past, when I first started driving, I almost caused an accident because I didn't pay enough attention, but luckily, there was no collision. Once I confirm that both directions are clear, I proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, so we can describe the observation process like that. Now, can you tell me about the specific details of how you handle the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake during a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
For the steering wheel, I turn it to the right and then straighten it after the turn. As for the accelerator, I usually don't press it during a right turn unless it's an emergency. I rely on the car's existing speed to make the turn. For the brake, I usually apply a bit of pressure while observing the situation. If there's any issue, I can stop the car immediately. After completing the turn, I then gently press the accelerator to match the speed of other vehicles and continue driving normally.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, and how much do you turn the steering wheel? Do you turn it to a fixed angle before making the turn, or do you adjust it continuously during the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually turn it to a certain angle and then hold it there.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you turn it to a certain angle and then keep your hands steady?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, unless I feel that the turn is not as I estimated, in which case I make adjustments during the turn. But on familiar roads, I know exactly how much to turn the wheel.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. How do you return the steering wheel to its original position? Do you do it gradually, all at once, or do you let the car's momentum help?

**Speaker 2:**
If you're asking about my habit, I usually let the steering wheel return on its own, and I keep my hands lightly on it unless necessary. However, if I'm driving a car I'm not familiar with, I might actively control it more.

**Speaker 1:**
Understood. Now, let's talk about the brake. When do you usually start braking for a turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I start braking when...
Speaker 1: Let's start with braking.

Speaker 2: Sure.

Speaker 1: When do you usually start braking before making a turn?

Speaker 2: Typically, I start braking when I approach a pedestrian crossing. I usually slow down as I get close to the crosswalk.

Speaker 1: So, you stop just before the stop line at the pedestrian crossing?

Speaker 2: Yes, I bring the front of the car right up to the stop line.

Speaker 1: Right, the front of the car.

Speaker 2: Yes, the very front of the car almost touches the stop line.

Speaker 1: If there are no pedestrians, you just proceed?

Speaker 2: Yes, if there are no pedestrians, I lightly tap the brake as a habit from my driving test, but I don't come to a full stop unless necessary. If there are no obstacles, I just lightly tap the brake to confirm the situation and then proceed.

Speaker 1: Okay, so during the turn, you rely on the car's momentum?

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: When do you start accelerating out of the turn?

Speaker 2: Once my car is aligned with the lane I want to drive in.

Speaker 1: Can you be more specific? For example, let's look at this video. When do you start accelerating?

Speaker 2: I start accelerating once I confirm there are no vehicles on my left side.

Speaker 1: So, you check your left side before accelerating?

Speaker 2: Yes, I make sure there are no vehicles on my left side before accelerating.

Speaker 1: Regarding the steering wheel, accelerator, brake, and observation, is there anything else?

Speaker 2: No, I think we've covered my usual routine unless there's a special situation.

Speaker 1: So, to summarize, you first check the left side through the front and side windows, then check the right side through the rearview mirror for pedestrians and cyclists?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1: When do you start observing the right side?

Speaker 2: After confirming the left side is clear, I start checking the right side.

Speaker 1: So, your observation is not dependent on the car's position?

Speaker 2: Correct.

Speaker 1: Do you ever check the left side while making a right turn?

Speaker 2: Not usually. I focus on the right side because a right turn doesn't typically affect the left side.
**Speaker 1:** Do you never look to the left side, or is there a specific time when you do?

**Speaker 2:** I almost never look to the left rear. In the video, I rarely check the left rear. Because I feel that when I turn right, it doesn't affect my left rear side, whether it's a fast-moving vehicle, a pedestrian, or a low-profile vehicle. I don't think it affects me.

**Speaker 1:** And you mentioned before that you rarely use this mirror.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the middle one. I rarely use it unless I'm driving on the highway.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, let's continue watching the video. Up ahead, there's a process where a side road merges into the main road. Can you describe your habits when merging from a side road? You can start describing now since we'll pause when we get there.

**Speaker 2:** It's actually quite similar to making a turn. I definitely pay attention to the vehicles on the main road. I usually observe the main road traffic through the left side window in advance. Just looking at the rearview mirror isn't enough when merging.

**Speaker 1:** When do you start checking through the left side?

**Speaker 2:** When I'm close to the merging point, but not too early. It's around the time when I'm about to merge.

**Speaker 1:** So, you check through the left window at that point?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, to see the traffic on the main road.

**Speaker 1:** Can you see clearly from the left side?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, unless there's something obstructing my view, like tall grass, which is rare and usually dangerous. Generally, I can see clearly. I mainly do this to avoid any parallel vehicles. When you turn, you can see the rear through the rearview mirror, but...

**Speaker 1:** Parallel vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, in the past, I only used the rearview mirror while driving normally. This led to a near-accident with a parallel vehicle in my blind spot. Since then, I make sure to check the left side for any parallel vehicles. If there are none, I use the rearview mirror to check the main road's traffic. If there are parallel vehicles, I adjust accordingly.

**Speaker 1:** So, you start this process at this point?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when I'm close to the merging point.

**Speaker 1:** Around this time?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a bit earlier, but around this point.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. And then?

**Speaker 2:** If there are no parallel vehicles, I start to slow down and prepare to brake slightly. When I reach the merging point, I make a final decision based on the current situation. But by this time, I've already started observing.
Speaker 1:
We can start braking a bit earlier. Then, when we get to the merging point, we make a decision based on the situation. But by that time, I’ve already started observing. Understand?

Speaker 2:
Got it. So, when we reach the merging point, what should we do?

Speaker 1:
If it’s the merging point, I would stop first, regardless of whether there are cars or not. If there are no cars, I would proceed directly. If there are cars, I would either let them go first or...

Speaker 2:
So, you start checking the left mirror only when you reach the merging point?

Speaker 1:
No, I wouldn’t check it before. I would first look ahead to see if there are any non-motorized vehicles on the left side. If there aren’t any, I would proceed. But I would still take a quick glance. When I reach the merging point, I would mainly use the left mirror to check.

Speaker 2:
And regardless of whether there are cars or not, you would stop?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I would stop. Definitely stop.

Speaker 2:
How long do you observe after stopping before deciding whether to proceed?

Speaker 1:
It’s based on intuition. When I feel it’s safe to go, I proceed.

Speaker 2:
Then you accelerate?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I accelerate to increase speed directly.

Speaker 2:
Not using idle speed?

Speaker 1:
No, because in such situations, if there are many cars...

Speaker 2:
When you stop and check the left mirror, do you move the steering wheel?

Speaker 1:
No, I don’t move the steering wheel.

Speaker 2:
So, the car stays straight. After observing no cars, you accelerate and then start moving the steering wheel?

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
Let’s check. You didn’t stop this time.

Speaker 1:
In this situation, because there were no cars behind.

Speaker 2:
There were no cars behind, so you didn’t need to stop.

Speaker 1:
But this is rare. Normally, during commuting, there would be cars behind.

Speaker 2:
So, today you just accelerated directly.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I just left directly.

Speaker 2:
When merging, do you usually prefer a specific part of the transition area?

Speaker 1:
It’s hard to describe, but I usually merge in a normal way.
**Speaker 1:**
So, when you enter the main road, which part of the lane do you usually prefer?

**Speaker 2:**
It's hard to describe exactly. I just merge in normally without a specific preference.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mean you usually merge in around here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, like in the second scenario.

**Speaker 1:**
Gradually, you try to merge in the transition area towards the end.

**Speaker 2:**
That's how I feel. But if there are no cars behind me, I might drive more casually. You can see that I usually merge in at the very end.

**Speaker 1:**
This part is essentially a straight driving section. Can you tell me about your driving habits on such straight roads with good conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't do much. I just keep my foot on the gas pedal or brake, occasionally checking the side and rearview mirrors to be aware of the surroundings. I don't move the steering wheel much, and my hands are usually resting on my lap.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you prefer to drive in the middle, left, or right side of the lane?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the road conditions and where I need to turn at the next intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. What do you mean by road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if there are many cars in my lane but fewer in the left lane, I prefer to drive in the lane with fewer cars. If both lanes are crowded...

**Speaker 1:**
I meant within the same lane, do you prefer the left, middle, or right side?

**Speaker 2:**
I tend to stay in the middle. I'm not comfortable staying too far left because I'm worried about cars in the left lane, especially if they need to make a U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
What speed do you usually maintain in such conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Between 40-60 km/h. Not too fast, not too slow.

**Speaker 1:**
So you keep the gas pedal steady at a certain level?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I keep it steady. This way, it's easier to brake if needed. I don't let the car coast; I always maintain control.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you usually maintain distance from the car in front of you?

**Speaker 2:**
I keep a consistent distance, adjusting as needed based on the speed and traffic conditions.
**Speaker 1:**
Can you tell me about your usual strategy for maintaining distance from the car in front of you? Let's use the car in the video as a reference and discuss your typical habits for keeping a safe distance.

**Speaker 2:**
Well, I generally keep a fairly large distance from the car in front, but not excessively large.

**Speaker 1:**
How large are we talking about?

**Speaker 2:**
A bit further back.

**Speaker 2:**
However, it depends on the situation. For instance, if we're far from the solid white line and the straight lane is heavily congested, and there are cars trying to merge from the left lane, I might shorten the distance a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if there's a chance that someone from the right lane might cut in, you would intentionally reduce the distance to the car in front?

**Speaker 2:**
Unless it's an emergency, I wouldn't engage in aggressive behavior. I dislike it when others cut in, so I might intentionally shorten the distance, but not to the point of being too close—usually about half a car length. Normally, I keep a larger distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's rewind a bit. Earlier, you mentioned making a U-turn. Can you describe your driving habits when making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
When making a U-turn, I start paying attention to the oncoming traffic well in advance.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you start observing the traffic early on?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, almost immediately before the U-turn. I assess the traffic situation ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean the cars coming from the opposite direction?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I judge the number of vehicles. If there are many, I feel uncomfortable and wait for them to pass before making the U-turn. If there are no cars, I proceed directly.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's delve into the details of your observation and actions.

**Speaker 2:**
When approaching a U-turn, I start observing the oncoming lane through the front side window once I pass the barrier. At this point, I don't use the rearview mirror much; I focus on the front side window to check for oncoming vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it.

**Speaker 2:**
If there are no or few vehicles, I proceed with the U-turn. If there are cars, I stop and wait for them to pass before turning.

**Speaker 1:**
When you make the U-turn, do you turn the steering wheel fully, or do you adjust it as you turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I adjust it as I turn, not fully locking it before starting the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you turn the wheel gradually during the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think so.
**Speaker 1:**
So, do you turn the wheel all the way before making the U-turn, or do you turn it during the process?

**Speaker 2:**
I turn it during the process.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you turn the wheel while making the U-turn, not before?

**Speaker 2:**
Let me think. Yes, I turn it while making the U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
There are two scenarios. One is when you make the U-turn at idle speed, slowly turning the wheel all the way. The other is when you press the brake, turn the wheel, and then release the brake to make the turn.

**Speaker 2:**
It's the first scenario, definitely the first one.

**Speaker 1:**
And you mentioned that during the U-turn, you don't check the side mirrors. So, where do you focus your attention?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually focus on the front windshield to observe the oncoming traffic. I don't make space for another car to turn with me, so I don't worry about the cars behind me unless they can somehow bypass the barrier, which they usually can't.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you make the U-turn closer to the barrier, ensuring there's no space for another car to follow you?

**Speaker 2:**
Not exactly. I assume that other drivers will wait for me to complete my turn. I don't hug the barrier too closely because the area isn't marked with a dashed line, which I'm not entirely comfortable with.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you stay within the dashed lines?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I stay within the dashed lines. I haven't encountered anyone trying to make the turn with me, so I don't check the mirrors. I also don't use the gas pedal much. I'm familiar with my car and know if I can make the turn in one go. Unlike today’s test drive, where we had to adjust halfway through, I usually know if I need to make adjustments early on.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, so when you start the U-turn, you turn the wheel to the left while moving slowly. How do you judge if you can make the turn in one go? Do you have any specific reference points inside the car?

**Speaker 2:**
When driving my own car, I'm familiar with the turning points at various intersections. I know if I can make the turn based on experience.

**Speaker 1:**
If you can't make the turn, do you straighten the wheel before reversing, or do you turn it slightly to the right?

**Speaker 2:**
I straighten the wheel before reversing.
**Speaker 1:**
When you reverse, do you straighten the steering wheel first, or do you turn it slightly to the right and then straighten it?

**Speaker 2:**
I straighten it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't make any large turns?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't.

**Speaker 1:**
When you turn right onto a main street, do you straighten the wheel after the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. At that point, I usually turn the wheel while moving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't stop to turn the wheel fully before moving again?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I turn the wheel while moving.

**Speaker 1:**
After you finish reversing and then make a left turn to complete the remaining half-circle, do you accelerate?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, usually at that point, there are many cars around, and I get anxious. Since there are no cars in front of me because they are all blocked on my right side, I accelerate a bit to move quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, besides being in a hurry, are there any other reasons you accelerate?

**Speaker 2:**
No, if there are no cars around, especially late at night, I wouldn't rush. But if I feel like I'm making others wait too long, I will.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. So, you only accelerate when there are no cars blocking you and you feel it's necessary to avoid making others wait too long.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. I've been in situations where I've had to wait, and I know how frustrating it can be.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed your car tends to veer to the right. Do you intentionally steer it that way?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
Is that a driving habit of yours?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it helps to increase the turning radius.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. So, you accelerate when you're blocked by many cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially when there are many cars behind me trying to turn as well.

**Speaker 1:**
Understood. When you're using navigation and driving at low speed, can you describe your habit of accelerating in a straight line?

**Speaker 2:**
When driving in a straight line, I don't pay much attention to the cars behind me. I mainly observe the road ahead through the front windshield to see if I can continue accelerating. If there's an intersection ahead, I check through the right side window to see if any cars are entering. If there are, I slow down in advance.
**Speaker 1:**
When you're accelerating in a straight line, do you observe your surroundings more frequently?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. Even during normal straight-line driving, I observe my surroundings.

**Speaker 1:**
And where do you focus your observations?

**Speaker 2:**
I focus on the road ahead and the right side, especially if there's an entrance where vehicles might merge. If I see a potential conflict, I slow down or honk. If there's no conflict, I accelerate normally but release the gas pedal before the entrance to be ready to slow down if needed. This way, if there's a sudden conflict with another vehicle, pedestrian, or animal, I can react quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you accelerate, do you press the gas pedal gradually or all at once?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't like pressing the gas pedal all the way down suddenly. I think it can harm the engine and I don't like sudden acceleration. If I need to accelerate quickly, like when making a U-turn, I press the pedal a bit more firmly but not all the way. Generally, I prefer to press the pedal gradually until I reach a comfortable speed, which I then maintain.

**Speaker 1:**
What speed do you usually accelerate to?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually accelerate to a speed between 40 to 60 km/h, depending on the traffic and road conditions, to maintain a comfortable driving experience.

**Speaker 1:**
During the formal experiment, did you perform any lane changes or overtaking maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't. But I can describe my usual habits when changing lanes or overtaking.

**Speaker 1:**
Please do.

**Speaker 2:**
When I decide to overtake, I first check the left rearview mirror to see if there are any vehicles behind me. If there's a vehicle following closely, I abandon the overtaking maneuver. 

**Speaker 1:**
When you check, do you move your car slightly to get a better view, or do you rely solely on the mirror?

**Speaker 2:**
I rely solely on the mirror. I don't move the car to get a better view unless it's absolutely necessary, like when crossing into the opposite lane for overtaking.
Speaker 1:
For example, when you slightly move the car forward.

Speaker 2:
No, it depends. Let me think. If it's a one-way street and you need to overtake on the left by moving into the oncoming lane, then I don't think so either.

Speaker 1:
So, you differentiate between borrowing a lane to overtake and overtaking in the left lane. Is that what you mean?

Speaker 2:
Yes, yes. If it's borrowing a lane to overtake, then what you mentioned might happen.

Speaker 1:
Like moving slightly to the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, just a little bit. If I notice something wrong, I quickly steer back. If there are no cars, I proceed with the maneuver. Do you understand? If it's a lateral lane, I only check the left side mirror. If there's no issue on the left, I immediately start overtaking by signaling left, moving into the overtaking lane, quickly overtaking, and then signaling right once I'm about a car length ahead.

Speaker 1:
So, you overtake by about a car length.

Speaker 2:
Yes, let me think.

Speaker 1:
How much distance do you leave between your car's rear and the front of the car you overtook before you move back to the original lane?

Speaker 2:
About half to a full car length. I make sure they can see my right turn signal. I am generally cautious when overtaking. I only move back when I'm sure they can see my right turn signal. After moving back, I drive normally. During the overtaking process, I also check the right mirror to see the distance between my car, the car behind, and the car I'm overtaking.

Speaker 1:
So, to confirm, when you overtake to the left, you only check the left side and nearby areas, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I don't check anything else. When moving back to the right lane, I only check the right side.

Speaker 1:
So, you don't check other lanes?

Speaker 2:
No, if there are four lanes, I only focus on the overtaking lane and the car I'm overtaking. I don't worry about the right side. Unless the road conditions are very complex, in which case I might give up overtaking. I prefer safety, especially when the conditions are not ideal. Safety is paramount when driving.

Speaker 1:
Okay. When you were making a right turn, could you see the situation on the right side?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I could see. In such situations, I start checking through the right window. If everything is clear, I proceed as usual, just like with the previous right turn, and then accelerate once I'm back in the normal lane.

Speaker 1:
Alright. Now, I have some other questions. To ensure safety during this driving experiment, what specific areas did you pay extra attention to?

Speaker 2:
What do you mean by specific areas?

Speaker 1:
I mean, compared to usual...
**Interviewer:** During this driving experiment, what specific areas did you pay extra attention to for safety?

**Driver:** Are you asking about specific areas of focus?

**Interviewer:** Yes, compared to your usual driving, were there any particular areas you paid more attention to today to ensure safety, or did you do anything extra?

**Driver:** I paid more attention to checking the rearview mirror more frequently. Normally, when I drive, I might get relaxed and not check as often, which can be unsafe. But during this drive, I made sure to keep my attention as if I were driving with passengers, constantly checking the mirrors.

**Interviewer:** Did you do anything else besides that?

**Driver:** No, just being more cautious internally.

**Interviewer:** Did you deliberately slow down your speed?

**Driver:** No, I didn't slow down deliberately. I drove at my usual speed, which is already cautious for this type of road. I don't usually drive very fast anyway.

**Interviewer:** In your opinion, what makes driving safer? Are there any specific actions or areas of focus that can enhance safety during such experiments?

**Driver:** I think being more cautious and attentive during the experiment is key.

**Interviewer:** So, you believe you were already driving much safer today because it was an experiment. Is there anything else you could do to be even safer?

**Driver:** No, I don't think so.

**Interviewer:** Do you think others could drive safer, not just you?

**Driver:** I don't think so. If I could think of something, I would have done it. If it's beyond my knowledge, then it's beyond my capability.

**Interviewer:** Can you recall any specific situations or scenarios from your usual driving experience that you find particularly frightening?

**Driver:** Yes, I find it particularly frightening when there is no clear separation between motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles.

**Interviewer:** Like when there are non-motor vehicles on the right side?

**Driver:** Yes, when there are no clear lanes separating motor vehicles from non-motor vehicles. I feel more comfortable when there are clear separations, like green belts or blue lines. For example, during the second lap of the experiment, there were many parents picking up their children, riding their bikes unsteadily, which made me very nervous.
**Speaker 1:**
Alright, besides that, are there any other situations that make you feel scared?

**Speaker 2:**
Very rarely. My main source of driving danger statistics comes from flying.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could potentially lead to risks or dangers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes I get distracted while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Especially on familiar routes?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. If I'm driving on a very familiar route, I might get distracted.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I think that's about it. When I'm a passenger, what makes me feel unsafe is when the driver frequently accelerates.

**Speaker 1:**
Frequent acceleration?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the road conditions are good, some drivers tend to maintain a very high speed. Many people I know, including family members, have this habit, and I really dislike it. Unless you're in a hurry, there's no need to drive so fast. For example, if you're just heading home after work and not in a rush, you should drive normally. But some people accelerate whenever there's no traffic, and I find that very annoying and dangerous. I also dislike it when drivers brake suddenly and harshly.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are other bad driving habits, like not using turn signals when turning or changing lanes, and sudden, unnecessary braking.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, this is the first left turn of the experiment. Can you describe your habits when making a left turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It's actually similar to making a right turn, just in the opposite direction. I observe the right side and the front through the right-side windows and mirrors. I don't usually check the left side mirror. When I see that the right side is clear, I proceed to check the left side. The main difference with a left turn is that there could be oncoming traffic from the left, so I also check the left front window and side window to ensure it's safe before making the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when making a left turn, you check both the left and right mirrors?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I make sure both sides are clear before proceeding.
Speaker 1:
When making a left turn, you should observe the traffic coming from the left side through the side window. Once you confirm that there are no issues, you can proceed.

Speaker 2:
So, when making a left turn, you don't use the side mirrors?

Speaker 1:
No, I don't use the side mirrors.

Speaker 2:
You only observe through the windows?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I only observe through the side windows and the front windshield.

Speaker 2:
Got it.

Speaker 1:
Okay. Is everything else the same as making a right turn, like the steering wheel and the brakes?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I personally feel it's the same.

Speaker 1:
Oh, is there a noticeable difference in the turning radius between left and right turns?

Speaker 2:
Yes, left turns tend to be tighter.

Speaker 1:
So, left turns are tighter, and right turns are wider?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because the distance for a left turn is generally longer, allowing for a smoother turn without needing to turn the wheel as much. Right turns are more like a sharp angle, so you need to turn the wheel more.

Speaker 1:
Do you usually pay attention to the passengers' comfort while driving?

Speaker 2:
Not really, unless they mention it. If they don't say anything, I don't worry about it. If it's someone I know well and we can talk, I might ask. Otherwise, I just drive normally and chat if they want to. If they feel uncomfortable, they usually tell me.

Speaker 1:
So, you don't actively focus on the passengers' comfort?

Speaker 2:
No, my attention is mainly on the road. Whether there are passengers or not doesn't make much difference to me.

Speaker 1:
Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
No, I don't think so. I believe my driving skills are quite good.

Speaker 1:
Even if it's safe, it might still be uncomfortable for passengers. Have you considered that?

Speaker 2:
I haven't really thought about it, and no one has mentioned it to me.

Speaker 1:
What kind of driving behavior from others makes you uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

Speaker 2:
Smoking and talking loudly on the phone.

Speaker 1:
Besides that, are there any driving maneuvers that make you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Not really. I rarely get car sick. But sudden sharp turns or hard braking can be uncomfortable because they feel unsafe.

Speaker 1:
So, you think sudden braking, sudden acceleration, and sharp turns are unsafe?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: You believe that sudden braking, sudden acceleration, and sharp turns are unsafe.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1: So, the discomfort you feel is mainly due to a lack of safety.

Speaker 2: Yes, it’s about the sense of safety.

Speaker 1: It's not really a physical discomfort, right?

Speaker 2: Right, exactly.

Speaker 1: Okay, I understand. So, we have a handle that you can press if you feel uncomfortable.

Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1: But we can't always match the exact time in the panoramic video with the moment you press the handle.

Speaker 2: Oh, what should we do then?

Speaker 1: So, it's difficult to find the corresponding scene.

Speaker 2: There are many instances.

Speaker 1: Do you have a baseline? No? Then let's move on. So, during today's experiment, you didn't consider the passenger's feelings at all, even though you knew they might press the handle when they felt uncomfortable.

Speaker 2: I know, I know.

Speaker 1: But you didn't take that into account?

Speaker 2: Not at all. This time, I drove as if I was alone, even though there were people sitting beside and behind me. I treated it as if I was driving alone.

Speaker 1: How do you think you can make the passengers feel more comfortable while driving?

Speaker 2: Should we distinguish between safety and comfort?

Speaker 1: If we don't need to distinguish, because you mentioned safety earlier...

Speaker 2: Now, if we talk about comfort...

Speaker 1: Yes, because you might not have considered it before.

Speaker 2: My first reaction is to drive safely. I have a question. For example, when they look at the handle, are they distinguishing between safety and comfort? I really can't figure it out.

Speaker 1: In dangerous scenarios, or when there are sudden accelerations, sudden braking, or sharp turns...

Speaker 2: Maintaining a steady speed might improve the comfort for passengers.

Speaker 1: Maintaining a steady speed?

Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. If you think from their perspective, maintaining a steady speed means the car is moving smoothly. It avoids the discomfort caused by sudden acceleration or deceleration, and it keeps the situation stable, which contributes to both comfort and safety.

Speaker 1: I see. Anything else?

Speaker 2: Keeping communication open with the passengers.

Speaker 1: You mean talking to them?

Speaker 2: Yes, chatting with them. If the passengers are people I know, or if we can have a good conversation, it helps. But we wouldn't talk about my driving; instead, we would discuss other topics.

Speaker 1: I want to ask you about a specific scenario...
Speaker 1:
Oh, I want to ask you about a scenario, and you can take a look. OK. During the test drive and the official experiment, there is this big blue word "down" in front. Yes, and I want to ask you, in a situation where there is a large vehicle blocking your view, what do you focus on?

Speaker 2:
I deliberately focus on the distance between my car and the large vehicle. I really dislike being close to large vehicles, so I try to maintain a reasonable distance. I am not extremely far, but I keep a safe distance. I am always worried that there might be sudden obstacles in front of the large vehicle, so my attention is mostly on the right side. In narrow lanes, I can monitor the right side while also keeping an eye on the oncoming traffic. However, if both lanes are equally congested, I don't pay much attention to the left front; my focus is mainly on the right side.

Speaker 1:
Besides communication and maintaining speed, is there anything else?

Speaker 2:
Not really.

Speaker 1:
Alright, some of the following questions might be a bit difficult to answer, so feel free to take your time. The first question is, what do you think makes a driver unprofessional?

Speaker 2:
Well, it's about maintaining safety. As long as you can drive safely, that's good.

Speaker 1:
So, safety equals good driving?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Safety is paramount. Comfort for passengers is also important, but safety comes first. A good driver should not have any faults in their driving. However, this is a very high standard and difficult for most people to achieve. So, as long as a driver can maintain safety, that's good enough.

Speaker 1:
Are you studying law? I guessed from the way you speak.

Speaker 2:
No, I studied economics in my undergraduate. We are working on this project now.

Speaker 1:
I see. What about professional drivers?

Speaker 2:
I would compare professional drivers to taxi drivers. They drive as their main job, so I consider them professional.

Speaker 1:
So, you think all drivers who drive as their main occupation are professional?

Speaker 2:
Not necessarily all taxi or ride-share drivers.
**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think that all professional drivers, like taxi and ride-hailing drivers, should be considered experts?

**Speaker 2:**
Not necessarily.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mean that not all taxi and ride-hailing drivers can be considered experts?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, their skill levels can vary significantly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what do you think defines a truly professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
A truly professional driver doesn't necessarily have to drive for a living, but all professional drivers should be capable of making a career out of driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, their skills should at least meet the standards required for professional drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, and often they exceed those standards.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, and that's just the basic requirement.

**Speaker 2:**
Additionally, they should be well-versed in handling any situation that might arise during driving. Whether it's city streets, rural roads, highways, bridges, elevated roads, or tunnels, they should be able to manage any scenario. While we can't expect them to handle every situation perfectly, they should be able to anticipate and respond to all potential issues. This is a key aspect of professional driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, to summarize, a good driver needs to ensure safety. A professional driver, on the other hand, must meet the technical skill requirements of a professional driver and...

**Speaker 2:**
And be able to handle any situation that might occur on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they need to manage any potential issues they might encounter?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Should they be able to handle these issues or also anticipate them?

**Speaker 2:**
Both.

**Speaker 1:**
If they can't anticipate, should they still be able to handle the situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they need to have good judgment and anticipation skills.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think it's better to handle situations without anticipation or to anticipate and handle them?

**Speaker 2:**
I believe handling situations without anticipation shows higher skill, but ideally, they should be able to anticipate and handle them.

**Speaker 1:**
Which do you think is more professional?

**Speaker 2:**
Anticipating and handling situations is more professional. We can't rely on them handling every situation perfectly without anticipation, especially when it concerns safety.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, we are approaching an intersection without traffic lights. We need to make a right turn. You slowed down significantly here. Was it because of the non-motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
It was a combination of factors.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it also because there were many cars coming from the left, and you had to stop?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I didn't want to compete with them for the right of way.
Speaker 1:
So, you stopped because you noticed there were a lot of cars coming from the left, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I didn't want to compete with them. Once I saw that all the cars had passed and there were no more coming, I proceeded.

Speaker 1:
At that point, you stopped again.

Speaker 2:
The reason was that I wasn't sure if the oncoming car was going to turn left. Many drivers don't use their turn signals, which is very frustrating.

Speaker 1:
You were worried about that car.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I had to make sure it wasn't going to turn before I moved. You can't assume that all drivers will signal their intentions. You have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.

Speaker 1:
Let's move on to the next question. What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

Speaker 2:
Experienced drivers tend to not follow the rules strictly.

Speaker 1:
Experienced drivers don't follow the rules?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they often don't use turn signals when changing lanes or turning, they don't slow down at intersections, and they drive very casually once they think it's safe. If you question them, they might say there's no problem, but they ignore the formalities that should be followed.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by formalities?

Speaker 2:
Traffic rules are designed to ensure safety and protect lives and property. For example, even if I think it's safe to change lanes or make a quick turn, I still use my turn signals. This is adhering to the formalities of traffic rules.

Speaker 1:
So, you think experienced drivers don't follow these formalities?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they think it's safe.

Speaker 1:
Why do you think they don't follow the rules?

Speaker 2:
I'm not sure. Maybe because they are too familiar with driving. They drive much more than I do, maybe four or five times more. They might think these rules are unnecessary. On the other hand, new drivers often follow the rules to the letter without really understanding the safety behind them.

Speaker 1:
So, new drivers follow the rules strictly, while experienced drivers abandon them. New drivers follow the rules without really judging if it's safe.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
A new driver often goes through the motions, while an experienced driver might become complacent. By "going through the motions," I mean the new driver performs the actions without truly assessing safety.

Speaker 2:
Well, it's not entirely like that. It could be that the new driver has developed a fixed routine, which they follow even when they're not very skilled.

Speaker 1:
They might just signal a turn without checking if it's safe behind them.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they are just following the requirement to signal when turning or overtaking during their training.

Speaker 1:
It's like they're executing a program rather than genuinely assessing safety.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, but many experienced drivers also don't...

Speaker 1:
They might think, "I'll signal for three seconds and then turn," without considering the road conditions after those three seconds.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but it varies from person to person. Many new drivers I know do this when they start driving.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Are there any other significant differences?

Speaker 2:
New drivers often have a rigid approach to assessing road conditions and executing maneuvers. For example, if there's a car ahead making a U-turn, many new drivers I've ridden with would just slam on the brakes.

Speaker 1:
And wait.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they wouldn't...

Speaker 1:
Slow down gradually.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Another thing is their abrupt actions, like suddenly accelerating or braking hard. It feels very stiff and unrefined, mainly due to inexperience.

Speaker 1:
Besides that, is there anything else?

Speaker 2:
Experience plays a big role. New drivers often can't handle unexpected situations well or anticipate potential issues in advance.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Not really. Now, a more challenging question: In what ways do you think autonomous driving can never match human driving?

Speaker 1:
I have a video...

Speaker 2:
I believe autonomous driving can never fully replicate human judgment of the environment.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by "judgment of the environment"?

Speaker 2:
For example, I recently saw a case where an autonomous car stopped because a shared bike was parked partially in its path. The car recognized the obstacle and couldn't move, even though a human driver could easily maneuver around it.

Speaker 1:
Why do you think it stopped?

Speaker 2:
It detected an obstacle and stopped, but a human would have found a way around it.
Speaker 1: Why do you think he let us go?

Speaker 2: Did he recognize an obstacle ahead and stop?

Speaker 1: He could have identified an obstacle ahead and then turned or maneuvered around it.

Speaker 2: Or let's take a more extreme example.

Speaker 1: I'm not saying he can't do it now, but even if we give him another ten, twenty, or even several decades of development, he will never be able to do it like a human.

Speaker 2: It's useless.

Speaker 1: Because the value you understand now is still very useful, with human assistance. But in reality, the capabilities of autonomous vehicles in the lab far exceed what you can imagine.

Speaker 2: It has already surpassed my understanding.

Speaker 1: Right, so we need to step out of your current understanding. From your perspective, you believe that no matter how much autonomous vehicles develop, they will never be able to do certain things like humans.

Speaker 2: I can mention a viewpoint that I don't fully agree with but find somewhat reasonable. For example, the judgment of sudden crisis situations in a short time. Many of these judgments are subconscious, almost non-human conscious decisions. It's purely structural, like a sudden swerve. In such situations, the driver might react instantly without even thinking.

Speaker 1: Right, they might not even consciously process it but react immediately.

Speaker 2: Yes, but many times, a driver's judgment in such situations is based on years of driving experience and understanding of different traffic accidents. This creates a driving intuition. Autonomous driving, being a machine, follows pre-set rules. If humans can't foresee a situation, it's hard for the machine to imagine it. Yet, in real life, unexpected situations often occur.

Speaker 1: Humans can make an instinctive reaction when facing a scenario they've never encountered before. You believe autonomous vehicles can't do this because they haven't seen it before.

Speaker 2: Exactly. The bigger issue is whether machines can surpass human thinking. I don't think they can.

Speaker 1: I understand. But you believe that in such situations, humans can instantly react, whether right or wrong.

Speaker 2: Yes, but machines might either not recognize the situation or make errors, leading to bugs or failures.
Speaker 1:
He might either follow a scenario where no situation arises, or if a situation does arise, he might not recognize it. This could lead to errors or bugs, or he might just ignore the situation altogether. This makes it difficult to surpass human capabilities.

Speaker 2:
He might follow what he thinks is the most similar scenario.

Speaker 1:
But this is based on previous judgments, and there will always be new situations. Without new situations, society wouldn't innovate.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Let's look at this intersection. When making a left turn, you first observe the front and right side. Right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, and then I assess if there's any situation on the right.

Speaker 2:
After this car makes a left turn, you stop.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I start looking to the right. If there's no issue, I then check the left for pedestrians. If there's a pedestrian moving slowly, and there's a car behind them...

Speaker 2:
Can I ask about the pedestrian crossing situation? How do you decide to pass in front of them?

Speaker 1:
Actually, at that moment, I was planning to stop.

Speaker 2:
I could see you were planning to stop.

Speaker 1:
But I noticed the pedestrian also stopped, and the car behind them stopped too. If I stopped, we would all be stuck. So, I decided to go.

Speaker 2:
You decided to go. But weren't you worried that the pedestrian might start moving again?

Speaker 1:
I was worried, so I kept my hand on the horn. But when I moved, they didn't, so I continued.

Speaker 2:
To prevent such situations, you kept your hand on the horn.

Speaker 1:
Yes, if the pedestrian had moved, I would have honked immediately. I wouldn't have relaxed.

Speaker 2:
I wouldn't relax either. If I stopped again, and they stopped, it would repeat the initial situation. If the pedestrian insisted on moving, I would brake hard.

Speaker 1:
So, you use the horn to communicate your intentions.

Speaker 2:
Yes, my hand was on the horn and the brake. I was ready.

Speaker 1:
So, you judged that since you moved and they didn't, they would let you pass.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they moved, I would honk and not stop. In everyday situations, I might even curse them.

Speaker 1:
Alright, I have two more questions. How do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving? Let's start with pedestrians.
**Interviewer:** How do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving? Let's start with pedestrians. For example, when you were at the crosswalk earlier, how did you determine the pedestrian's intention? Are there other ways you assess a pedestrian's intentions?

**Driver:** Yes, in that example, I judged whether the pedestrian would continue crossing the street based on whether they stopped or continued walking after I started moving. 

**Interviewer:** So, you focus on whether they are walking or not?

**Driver:** Yes, I don't pay attention to the finer details. I just care if they are walking or not.

**Interviewer:** When you judge a pedestrian's intention, what do you observe? How do you make your judgment?

**Driver:** I observe their actions, mainly their movements.

**Interviewer:** Specifically, what movements do you focus on? Their arms, legs, or something else?

**Driver:** Mainly two things: first, I focus on their legs to see if they stop or not. This is the most crucial and primary indicator. Sometimes, people might give hand signals, like waving you to go first or signaling you to stop. In such cases, I follow their signals. But primarily, I look at their legs. If their legs haven't stopped moving, even if they wave, I assume they will continue walking.

**Interviewer:** So, the legs are the most critical indicator. What if you can't determine their intention from their legs?

**Driver:** It's rare that I can't determine their intention from their legs. They either walk or stop. 

**Interviewer:** Right, so if their legs are moving, you will stop. If their legs stop, and you can't determine their intention, you look for other signals, like hand gestures.

**Driver:** Yes, if they signal for me to go, even if they are standing still, I will proceed.

**Interviewer:** I see. Even if they are standing and signal for you to stop, you will stop and let them go first.

**Driver:** Yes, in such cases, I usually raise my hand to signal them to go first. If they signal for me to stop, I let them go first.

**Interviewer:** Understood. You mentioned earlier that you might use hand signals to let someone go first, like when you were about to turn and saw a delivery person.

**Driver:** Yes, when I was about to turn, I slowed down, and the delivery person was coming from behind on the right. He was going straight, so I waved for him to go first. He saw my signal and proceeded.

**Interviewer:** Besides these, are there any other methods you use?

**Driver:** In Xi'an, there are almost no pedestrians. In Beijing, it's busier, and there are more pedestrians, so I have to be more cautious.

**Interviewer:** What about non-motorized vehicles?
**Speaker 1:**
So, how do you handle pedestrians, especially in busy areas like Beijing?

**Speaker 2:**
In busy areas, I find it challenging to predict pedestrian behavior. They can be quite unpredictable.

**Speaker 1:**
What about non-motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
When it comes to non-motorized vehicles, I mainly focus on observing my surroundings, especially when making turns. I always give them the right of way.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you avoid making judgments about their movements?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I try to avoid making risky judgments. It's difficult to predict their intentions accurately.

**Speaker 1:**
You find it risky to predict their intentions?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. Even if I think I can predict their movements accurately, there's always a chance I might be wrong. If I misjudge and hit someone, it would be disastrous.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you prefer to yield to them completely?

**Speaker 2:**
Not always. If a bicycle is moving slowly, I might not need to make a judgment. If I'm confident and there's enough space, I'll make the turn without needing to predict their movements. It's unrealistic to expect a bicycle to suddenly accelerate towards you.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 2:**
For electric bikes, I always let them go first. For bicycles, if I think they can pass safely, I let them go. If there's enough distance for me to turn safely, I proceed without hesitation.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the intentions of motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
I try to avoid making assumptions about motorized vehicles as well. If there's a car, I let it go first. You can't always rely on other drivers to signal their intentions properly. Many drivers don't use turn signals or brake lights correctly. So, my approach is to yield unless they stop completely.

**Speaker 1:**
Typically, you would use turn signals and brake lights to judge a vehicle's intentions. Do you use any other methods?

**Speaker 2:**
Primarily, I rely on turn signals and brake lights. If a car signals, I assume it will turn.

**Speaker 1:**
What if the car doesn't signal or use its lights? How do you judge then?

**Speaker 2:**
In that case, I rely on my instincts and experience. If a car suddenly turns without signaling, I need to react quickly. My general approach is to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for sudden changes.
**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge and react in situations where another driver makes sudden, unexpected moves, like turning without signaling?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. This way, even if they make extreme maneuvers, I can react quickly without having to predict their actions. I don't rely on guessing what they might do.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe a specific situation?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if I'm about to make a right turn and there's a vehicle on my right side, I need to be aware of its movements. Let's say there's a delivery person in a yellow uniform ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it the one on the right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he keeps looking at me and signaling with his hand. I need to be cautious and let him pass.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you turn your body to signal him?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I need to check my right and rear-right sides before turning. It's clear that he sees me. If there's any doubt, I make sure to signal my intentions clearly.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's imagine a scenario at an intersection without traffic lights. There are pedestrians and you both stop at the same time. If you both start moving simultaneously, it could lead to a dangerous situation. How would you handle this?

**Speaker 2:**
In such a case, I would use the same approach as before. If there's no car behind me, I would stop and signal the pedestrian to go first. If there is a car behind me, I might need to consider the traffic flow and efficiency.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you adjust your actions based on the traffic conditions behind you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if there's a car behind me, I aim for a more efficient approach for both myself and the car behind me.
Speaker 1:
Do you think this efficiency is more about your own efficiency, or is it about the overall efficiency for you and the cars behind you?

Speaker 2:
I don't want to block a lot of cars. For me, efficiency doesn't matter much. I'm not very daring. If we set aside any urgent reasons, like rushing home or somewhere else, and it's just about commuting, I would definitely let them go first.

Speaker 1:
What about non-motorized vehicles? Would you handle it the same way?

Speaker 2:
Yes, basically the same principle. It's actually easier to judge with non-motorized vehicles because they have to put their foot down when they stop.

Speaker 1:
So you judge whether to let them go based on whether the driver has put their foot down?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's easier to judge than with pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
Another scenario is when a group of people is crossing the street. They might not pay attention and just cross when there are enough of them. If you let the first person go, the rest might follow, and you could end up waiting for a long time. Would you still wait?

Speaker 2:
I wouldn't take unnecessary risks because of that. Safety is my top priority when driving. Unless it's an extremely special situation, I wouldn't let it affect my driving safety. If a non-motorized vehicle is trying to squeeze in and it threatens my safety, I would let them go. I might curse them, but I wouldn't argue or fight for the road. I think that's a reasonable approach.

Speaker 1:
I think that's all from my side. The interview is over, and there's a form you need to fill out.

Speaker 2:
Sure, I can do that.
