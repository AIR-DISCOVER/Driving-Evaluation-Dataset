**Speaker 1:**
Let's start by discussing our recent car purchase experience. First, let me ask you a few questions.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure.

**Speaker 1:**
How often do you usually take a car or drive? Do you often take public transportation?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually walk.

**Speaker 1:**
From the Third Ring Road to the Sixth Ring Road?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
How long does it usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
For that distance?

**Speaker 1:**
About 30 minutes, sometimes over 40 minutes.

**Speaker 2:**
30 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you take the bus?

**Speaker 2:**
Or?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, sometimes the bus, sometimes...

**Speaker 2:**
Didi.

**Speaker 1:**
The bus or Didi.

**Speaker 2:**
Right.

**Speaker 1:**
Regarding this recent test drive, how did you find the vehicle? And what do you think about the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver's skills were okay, but the seating was a bit cramped. The seats were quite hard, which made the ride uncomfortable, especially on bumpy roads.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 2:**
The road conditions transmitted a lot of vibrations.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for walking distances? For example, an SUV, a gasoline car, an electric car, or a sedan?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends.

**Speaker 1:**
If you were alone, what would you choose? And if you had more passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
If I had more passengers, I would choose an SUV.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mentioned electric cars. Do you prefer them because they are quieter and more environmentally friendly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Is noise level an important factor for you when choosing a vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it is.

**Speaker 1:**
Electric cars are quieter and have fewer emissions compared to gasoline cars, which can be noisy and have a strong smell after refueling.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the comfort level of the seats? Does that matter to you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does. For example, in the car we tested today, the front seats had enough legroom, but the seat support didn't cover my thighs properly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, sitting for a long time could be uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it could be very uncomfortable for my thighs.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive often?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't drive.
**Speaker 1:** Do you drive often?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't drive. I have a license, but I haven't driven in a long time.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:** I think I could drive if I needed to.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever taken any driving lessons?

**Speaker 2:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, let's take a look at this driving record video. We'll watch the entire process, and I'll ask you some questions. If you notice anything that feels unsafe, uncomfortable, or negatively impacts the experience, please let me know.

**Speaker 2:** Sure, let's do that.

**Speaker 1:** Is the noise coming from the trunk, or is it something else?

**Speaker 2:** It seems to be coming from the back seat.

**Speaker 1:** It sounds like a fan. It might be some equipment installed in the car.

**Speaker 2:** Possibly.

**Speaker 1:** When the driver makes a turn, how does it make you feel?

**Speaker 2:** It feels a bit uncertain.

**Speaker 1:** Do you remember any specific instances where the turning felt particularly noticeable?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, except for this one time.

**Speaker 1:** The driver seems to be executing the turns steadily. How does this steady execution make you feel?

**Speaker 2:** It feels more controlled and safe.

**Speaker 1:** When making a U-turn, do you usually turn the steering wheel all the way?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I try to make the turn in one go without reversing.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver reverse slightly during the turn because there wasn't enough space?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it seemed like the space on the right front wasn't enough.

**Speaker 1:** If a less experienced driver were in this situation, do you think they might struggle?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it could be challenging for a new driver.

**Speaker 1:** Now, we're in a straight acceleration phase. How does this straight acceleration feel to you?

**Speaker 2:** It feels smooth and controlled.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think about driving alongside or behind a bicycle?

**Speaker 2:** It can be a bit nerve-wracking.

**Speaker 1:** With intelligent systems in cars, they usually have sensors to detect obstacles. How do you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** It makes me feel safer, knowing the car can assist in avoiding collisions.
**Speaker 1:** This intelligent system, when integrated into the car, usually activates when the car is started or when it reaches a certain speed. It has a smart system that assists the driver. However, for electric bikes or regular bicycles, you need to be very cautious. The cameras can detect them, but you still need to be vigilant.

**Speaker 2:** I see. It seems like when driving on this particular road, the system tends to make more adjustments based on the conditions ahead.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly. For instance, when a pedestrian crosses the road, the system will automatically adjust.

**Speaker 2:** That's impressive.

**Speaker 1:** It should be standard for all vehicles, I think.

**Speaker 1:** At that moment, the system makes the necessary adjustments. Yes, it does.

**Speaker 2:** How does it feel?

**Speaker 1:** It's quite accurate.

**Speaker 2:** And last time?

**Speaker 1:** It wasn't as noticeable.

**Speaker 1:** The sensation wasn't as strong.

**Speaker 1:** But when a large vehicle passes by, you can feel it.

**Speaker 1:** And...

**Speaker 1:** There was a moment when the system seemed to hesitate, like it was processing something.

**Speaker 2:** Is that so?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it seemed to hesitate.

**Speaker 2:** I see.

**Speaker 1:** Then it adjusted and made a turn.

**Speaker 2:** Onto the side road.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, when it entered the side road, it made the necessary adjustments.

**Speaker 2:** Understood.

**Speaker 1:** I have a few more questions. During this trip, did you notice any particularly dangerous maneuvers by the driver? How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:** You mentioned the entrance earlier, the way the driver handled it.

**Speaker 1:** Can you recall your usual experiences as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** Sure.

**Speaker 1:** What situations inside or outside the car make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:** For instance, when the driver is speeding or following too closely behind another vehicle. On highways, maintaining a steady speed is crucial.

**Speaker 1:** If you accelerate too quickly without releasing the gas pedal, the car might jerk.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's quite strong.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly. When you release the gas pedal, especially in electric cars, you can feel the deceleration.

**Speaker 2:** Because it might decelerate abruptly.

**Speaker 1:** How should one handle that, especially in tight spots?

**Speaker 1:** Regarding safety, I wasn't clear on something you mentioned earlier. Some drivers prefer to release the gas pedal in electric cars. Does this relate to the driver's skill level?

**Speaker 1:** You suggested releasing the gas pedal. How does that feel?

**Speaker 1:** And you've already mentioned this maneuver, but I wanted to ask again...
**Speaker 1:**
Some drivers prefer to choose the eastern route. OK.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned that suggestion, that feeling.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you've already talked about the operation. But let me ask, what actions by drivers do you think are particularly scary or require a lot of attention?

**Speaker 2:**
Besides what?

**Speaker 1:**
Like, what do you think is particularly dangerous? For example, if the driver gets too chatty and starts telling stories while driving. Why tell stories?

**Speaker 2:**
It would be safer in Xi'an.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned you drive as well, right? What bad driving habits do you think you have that might cause danger? Do you always stay fully focused while driving? I'm really scared of driving with one hand.

**Speaker 2:**
Everyone does that.

**Speaker 1:**
But I mean, including those who drive more dangerously.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's true.

**Speaker 1:**
When you drive like that.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Testing over 100 times.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it because you're not very skilled, so you drive at high speeds? You need to feel the rhythm of the steering wheel, not too aggressive.

**Speaker 1:**
On the highway, because you're not very skilled, it can be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
About that handle you mentioned earlier.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the wind.

**Speaker 1:**
The bumpy section we just saw, did it get recorded? The bumps we saw earlier, when you helped him navigate those turns.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
And later, when he turned back, if he had some expectations, if he had to re-cover that area, would you set it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Almost.

**Speaker 2:**
At this point.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, he came back in two stages.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
After coming in, this section, you see.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
OK.

**Speaker 1:**
Was there an error?

**Speaker 1:**
Besides this, is there anything else? According to him, there are quite a few, just within this area.

**Speaker 1:**
What I'm telling you now is that the third step is very small, not sure how to enter this area, and then.

**Speaker 2:**
Here.

**Speaker 1:**
Between these two points, this section of the road.

**Speaker 1:**
Mainly the feeling of bumps.

**Speaker 1:**
You will notice it more clearly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think it's uncomfortable or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think drivers should pay attention to the comfort of passengers while driving? Do they actually pay attention?

**Speaker 1:**
Tomorrow.

**Speaker 2:**
Time?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think drivers should pay attention to passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
Data?

**Speaker 1:**
If it's like an app, they generally don't care much.

**Speaker 1:**
When you usually ride in someone else's car, what behaviors from others make you...
**Speaker 1:**
If you use an app like this, it generally doesn't operate poorly.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel uncomfortable? Just randomly, any kind.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure.

**Speaker 1:**
As we mentioned earlier, this is about shifting focus and value. Communication with passengers is part of it.

**Speaker 2:**
I have WeChat for that.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you also initiate conversations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if a driver starts smoking 17 seconds into the ride, how would you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
Would you mind?

**Speaker 1:**
When you start chatting, do you prefer a driver who is focused on driving or one who engages in conversation? It depends on the situation. Sometimes I enjoy chatting with drivers to learn about different lifestyles and perspectives.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
What are some of your driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Like what?

**Speaker 1:**
For instance, when driving an electric car, certain behaviors might be more noticeable. Do you have any insights from your own driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
What time are you referring to?

**Speaker 1:**
Because of the acceleration in electric cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Right. What do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver?

**Speaker 1:**
A good driver should be able to anticipate situations in advance. It's crucial to be prepared.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
What's the biggest difference?

**Speaker 1:**
I've been driving for a while.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Experienced drivers, especially those who have driven manual cars for decades, can often predict what other drivers will do next just by observing them.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. And you?

**Speaker 1:**
I haven't been driving for long.

**Speaker 2:**
What aspects of driving do you think autonomous cars will never be able to achieve?

**Speaker 1:**
Other aspects.

**Speaker 1:**
Currently, autonomous driving technology is still in its early stages. While driver-assist features are helpful, they can't fully replace human judgment. For example, if your car has a 360-degree camera, it can detect and navigate tight spaces. However, on highways, it can't maintain consistent speed and handle all situations for you.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the recent trip was managed by the car's adaptive cruise control?

**Speaker 1:**
Almost.

**Speaker 1:**
If the recent trip was fully autonomous, the driver might have just been a safety monitor, possibly pretending to drive.
**Speaker 1:**
Thank you.

**Speaker 1:**
I almost got it.

**Speaker 1:**
If we consider that the car was on autopilot and the driver was just a safety officer pretending to drive, how do you think this experience would differ from your usual driving experiences?

**Speaker 2:**
It would be shocking.

**Speaker 1:**
But I feel that the autopilot would handle the driving in such close proximity. If it were autopilot, it would detect objects and react accordingly.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you recall any details from the trip that made you feel the driver might not have been a real person?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
When you were crossing an intersection without traffic signals, how did you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles or drivers? As a pedestrian, how did you determine the intentions of the cars?

**Speaker 2:**
When I'm at home, cars always stop for pedestrians. But in Beijing, this happens less frequently. I noticed that more advanced cars tend to stop automatically.

**Speaker 1:**
So, how do you interact with these cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I quickly cross the street.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you look at the direction the cars are heading to predict their movements?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I try to anticipate their actions.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you choose to cross the street regardless of the cars' movements, or would you wait for a clear opportunity?

**Speaker 2:**
I would wait and look for a safe moment to cross.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything else you would like to share about this experience?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's all. Thank you.

**Speaker 1:**
Thank you. Oh, by the way, we need you to sign this document for our records.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, no problem.
