**Speaker 1:**
So, it's me.

**Speaker 2:**
First, I want to thank you again for coming to our venue. Since our meeting room isn't available, we'll start with some simple questions. Do you often travel by car? Are your trips usually long or short?

**Speaker 1:**
I usually take short trips on a daily basis.

**Speaker 2:**
How long do these trips typically last?

**Speaker 1:**
Well, when I travel, it's usually for leisure. It's more of an experience.

**Speaker 2:**
I see. So, it's not very frequent. How did you feel about the vehicle we used for this experiment?

**Speaker 1:**
It felt okay. Not particularly great. On a scale of 1 to 7, I'd give it around a 5.

**Speaker 2:**
A 5 out of 7. Got it. And what did you think of our driver's skills?

**Speaker 1:**
The driver was good, better than average. But I wouldn't say they were exceptional. There were no major risks, but it wasn't outstanding either. So, I'd still rate it around a 5 out of 7.

**Speaker 2:**
If you had a choice, what type of vehicle would you prefer for your trips?

**Speaker 1:**
I prefer stability.

**Speaker 2:**
In terms of vehicle type, do you prefer SUVs, gasoline cars, electric cars, or sedans?

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, do you find the acceleration too fast?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, sometimes the acceleration can be too abrupt, making it uncomfortable, especially if you're carrying items or taking photos.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think SUVs are more stable than sedans?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, SUVs tend to be more stable.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you drive often? How would you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 1:**
I drive regularly. I think I'm a decent driver.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright, let's move on to the next part. We'll watch a video of your driving experience. I want to confirm that you didn't press the button at 9:11, correct?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay, let's start the video. If at any point during the video you feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or have any negative experiences, please let me know immediately.

**Speaker 1:**
Sure, I'll let you know.
**Speaker 1:** If you feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or have a bad experience, you can tell me directly. Okay?

**Speaker 2:** Sure, let's discuss it. For example, during the driving process, there are many turns. How did you feel about the driver's turning maneuvers during the entire journey?

**Speaker 1:** I didn't find anything particularly outstanding. It felt just like a normal driving experience.

**Speaker 2:** The driver made a right turn and then entered the service road from the main road. How did you feel about this maneuver?

**Speaker 1:** I think I might have some personal habits. I usually try to judge whether the driver is going to continue straight or make a turn. In this case, he made a U-turn, which was a bit unexpected for me.

**Speaker 2:** How did you feel at that moment?

**Speaker 1:** Since I didn't know the exact route, I was trying to figure out his intentions. I usually observe the speed and the way the driver handles the accelerator. It's just my personal habit.

**Speaker 2:** Another question, from the user's perspective, how did you feel about the sudden stop?

**Speaker 1:** I thought he was going to continue straight, but then he stopped. It was a bit surprising.

**Speaker 2:** Are you referring to the stop at the traffic light?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, he stopped at the traffic light, which is normal given the road conditions.

**Speaker 2:** So, when he stopped, you thought he was going to continue straight, but he actually stopped. Is that correct?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:** Did this surprise you? How intense was the surprise?

**Speaker 1:** It was a mild surprise. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it around 2 or 3. It wasn't particularly shocking, just a bit unexpected.
**Speaker 1:** Hmm, if the degree of driving abroad meets the standards, I wouldn't have joined the second team.

**Speaker 2:** Two or three points.

**Speaker 1:** There wasn't anything particularly special, just that. Although it wasn't about execution, it was about changing direction.

**Speaker 2:** I want to ask further, if you had known the driving route in advance, would your experience have been different?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, if I had known, I think it would have been different.

**Speaker 2:** So it wouldn't have been the same.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:** The GPS on the phone didn't announce the directions. Oh, OK. And you mentioned that you paid close attention to the driver's actions, especially when they were accelerating?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I would look at the speedometer. Even if I couldn't see it clearly, I would still try to check it.

**Speaker 2:** So you were watching the speed as well?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:** What prompted you to develop this habit?

**Speaker 1:** Because...

**Speaker 2:** The electric car was driving slowly?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I didn't have this habit before. It started when I went to Hangzhou. In Hangzhou, most of the cars are electric. During those days, I began to pay more attention. If a car was driving too fast, I would get worried. I hoped the driver would maintain a reasonable speed. If they were driving too slow or too fast, I would tell them.

**Speaker 2:** If the driver was driving too slow or too fast, would it affect your experience?

**Speaker 1:** Definitely. Starting from 65 km/h and accelerating.

**Speaker 2:** As long as it's within the allowed speed limit and not exceeding it.

**Speaker 2:** Do you have a preferred speed range that you find comfortable?

**Speaker 1:** It depends on the situation. Generally, for starting and driving on the highway, I prefer a speed between 100 and 110 km/h. Below 100 km/h feels too slow, and above 110 km/h feels too fast.

**Speaker 2:** OK.

**Speaker 2:** When the driver accelerates, especially in a straight line, how do you feel about that?

**Speaker 1:** I feel scared, especially if the acceleration is sudden. If the speed increases too quickly, it makes me anxious.

**Speaker 2:** But the driver's actions didn't make you feel that way this time?

**Speaker 1:** No, this time it was fine.

**Speaker 2:** And how do you feel about the steady speed maintenance?

**Speaker 1:** I feel comfortable with it.
**Speaker 1:** But this data operation didn't give you that feeling.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Next, we have a steady-speed driving scenario.

**Speaker 2:** How did you feel during this steady-speed driving?

**Speaker 2:** Did you notice any changes? This section of the road is quite complex, with 50 entrances and no traffic lights. How did you feel when passing through these entrances?

**Speaker 1:** It was fine. I thought you would mention something to focus on.

**Speaker 2:** Is this the road, Zhihua? The one on the right?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, that's the one.

**Speaker 1:** Did you see that we need to turn right? If we go straight, we would pass through the middle of that gate. There's a road there, but how about that intersection?

**Speaker 2:** Zhihua, this is an area you usually pay attention to. It's quite complex.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, if our experiment is about that. Because this section is relatively simple. If we just started and there was something to focus on, since there was no turn, we couldn't see the right turn leading to the public mechanism competition. I would definitely pay attention.

**Speaker 2:** So, you pay more attention to complex road conditions because you know that area is usually tricky.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, there was a period when it was almost always congested.

**Speaker 2:** Like the market and the car dealership near the subway station.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the traffic flow there is high. Now, it might not be as impactful, especially since the traffic has reduced. We have an entrance without traffic lights, and the flow there hasn't recovered quickly. It could be problematic when there are fewer people, but during peak times, the interaction rate and traffic flow are very high.

**Speaker 2:** When you see pedestrians crossing the road here, how do you feel?

**Speaker 2:** Let's speed up a bit. We're almost done. Do you have any thoughts or comments about the driving process that you want to share with us?

**Speaker 1:** I'm not sure about your final usage of this data.

**Speaker 2:** It's mainly about two aspects: safety and comfort.

**Speaker 1:** Regarding safety, I have a suggestion. You should ensure current conditions are met.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** And why? Because I think it's good so far. There's no unpleasant smell, and nothing like over 600.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there's no such smell.

**Speaker 1:** The lack of odor is good. If you could do that...

**Speaker 2:** This? If you want to mix...
**Speaker 1:**
The taste, um, and I think it's good this way, it's interesting. Um, if you might, I could do it for you.

**Speaker 2:**
This? This. If you mix it up and roll it.

**Speaker 2:**
Let's ask a few more questions. During the driving process just now, did you notice any dangerous maneuvers?

**Speaker 1:**
Um, I was just thinking about the issues.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 1:**
Um, I feel that first, if you observe the situation around you, you can avoid about 90% of the issues. Basically, it's all about proportion.

**Speaker 2:**
When you talk about speed control, do you mean driving slower, or...?

**Speaker 1:**
Speed control? You can't drive too slowly either.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, driving too slowly on the highway can sometimes be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
If you drive too slowly, it might cause an accident because of the cars behind you.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright, please recall your usual experiences as a passenger. What situations inside or outside the car made you feel scared or unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**
From an altitude of over 4,000 meters, with more than a dozen bends, descending to about 1,000 meters, and then there was a road. 

**Speaker 1:**
At that time, I reported two things, and I felt... I had to put them here. Also, there was another time when I had to get to work. But later, a passenger asked me, and I shared my experience. On National Highway 108, driving 90 kilometers took 90 minutes because the entire highway was full of S-shaped bends. 

**Speaker 1:**
Usually, I would sit in the back, but this time I didn't. The driver told me not to sit in the front if I was afraid of getting dizzy. But I sat in the front, and the driver accelerated to over 60 km/h, drifting on the mountain road. I begged him to slow down, saying I could miss the high-speed train. Since then, I have been very cautious about acceleration. I never felt this way until that time when I sat in the front. After that, I became very sensitive and concerned about it.

**Speaker 2:**
So, it's about speed control in such situations.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the start-stop speed.

**Speaker 2:**
Start-stop speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if you can't drive smoothly and accelerate too quickly, especially on bends, it's terrifying. It can be very dangerous.

**Speaker 2:**
Like rapid acceleration or sudden starts.

**Speaker 1:**
And then there's the issue of external factors, which also play a role.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think the impact is greater from external factors or from rapid acceleration and sudden starts?

**Speaker 1:**
Normally, in the mountains, it's not about rapid acceleration or sudden starts, but on new roads, it's different. The situation is...
**Speaker 1:**
Normally, if it's not a sudden stop or a sandy road in the mountains, but if it's a new road, the official route is what I would theoretically consider. I feel very anxious, but it also depends on the specific road conditions. The road conditions where my family drives are very challenging, and I worry about whether my heart can handle any unexpected situations. This is a psychological concern. The second time, it was more of a physical danger because I was indeed in the car. I felt my heart was very uncomfortable, and I was extremely terrified. So, I described two different situations. The first one...

**Speaker 2:**
The first time was at an altitude of several thousand meters, right? It was more of a psychological issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it was more of a psychological issue. The driving conditions were very... Yes, I think the second time was more about the driver's habits and skills.

**Speaker 2:**
So, what do you think are the actions of the driver that make you feel particularly scared and unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**
First, I think sudden stops are a big issue. Also, when starting or stopping suddenly, especially during turns, I have a deep impression of sudden turns. For example, sharp turns or when the car is new, or on rainy days, any sudden changes or turns make me very anxious.

**Speaker 2:**
What kind of sudden changes? Quick turns?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, quick turns.

**Speaker 2:**
So, quick turns make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I think when the driver is adjusting the car quickly, it makes me very nervous. For example, in the south, now in Beijing, the traffic is very light. But when driving quickly, I feel that if I were to buy a car, I would definitely drive it around to get used to it.

**Speaker 2:**
If you were driving, would you skip this issue? Also, do you think drivers should pay attention to the comfort of their passengers? Do you think the drivers you usually ride with pay attention to this?

**Speaker 1:**
I think most drivers don't pay attention to this. Some drivers might have issues themselves; they drive either too fast or too slow, which affects the overall experience. But if a driver doesn't like driving, they might not care about the passengers' comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
I see.

**Speaker 1:**
I'm not sure about this because I don't usually drive myself.
**Speaker 1:** When I drive, I like to get into a comfortable routine and make sure everything is set up properly.

**Speaker 2:** What time did you start today?

**Speaker 1:** I'm not sure about that because I don't usually keep track. I just focus on my own driving.

**Speaker 2:** I felt that the ride was quite smooth. Do you usually feel comfortable when riding in other people's cars? What behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:** Well, certain behaviors can be unsettling, especially if the driver is going too fast or making sudden moves. It's important to drive smoothly and predictably.

**Speaker 2:** What do you think makes a good or professional driver? What qualities should they have?

**Speaker 1:** A good driver pays attention to details and ensures safety. They should be able to handle the car smoothly and be aware of their surroundings at all times.

**Speaker 2:** What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a new driver?

**Speaker 1:** Experienced drivers tend to be more confident and can handle unexpected situations better. They don't rely too much on navigation systems and have a good sense of direction.

**Speaker 2:** So, you mean that over-reliance on navigation can indicate a lack of direction sense?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, especially in complex areas like cities with many overpasses. A driver who can't navigate without constant guidance might struggle in such environments.

**Speaker 2:** What aspects of driving do you think autonomous cars will never be able to replicate as well as human drivers?

**Speaker 1:** Autonomous cars might struggle in unpredictable weather conditions or complex traffic situations. Human intuition and experience are hard to replicate.

**Speaker 2:** Do you think speed control is better managed by humans or by autonomous systems?

**Speaker 1:** Speed control can be well-managed by autonomous systems, but human judgment is crucial in certain situations.
**Speaker 1:** Can you share an experience you had in a special driving situation?

**Speaker 2:** Was it about controlling the speed or was it more about the AI control? I mean, was the autonomous driving system performing well?

**Speaker 1:** It was about controlling the speed. Sometimes, it might be better to let the system handle it because it can be more consistent. Personally, I find it relatively simple to manage, but it depends on the situation.

**Speaker 2:** Do you think the recent trip was driven manually or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 1:** Initially, I thought it was manual. At least, that's what I assumed at the beginning. But as the trip progressed, I started to think it might be autonomous. I couldn't be sure.

**Speaker 2:** Why did your opinion change? What made you think it was autonomous later on?

**Speaker 1:** Well, during the day, I couldn't predict how the system would perform. I usually make a prediction about the driving behavior, but this time, it seemed different. The way the driver handled the vehicle, the smoothness of the operations, and the overall experience felt more like an autonomous system.

**Speaker 2:** So, you're saying the experience was consistent with your usual expectations of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:** Not exactly. I felt a difference, especially during turns. The driver's actions and my own experience didn't quite match up.

**Speaker 2:** You mean the driver's maneuvers didn't align with your usual driving experience?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly. My senses and the way my body reacted to the driving felt different. It seemed more like an autonomous system was in control.

**Speaker 2:** If the vehicle was indeed autonomous and the driver was just a safety operator, how would that change your experience?

**Speaker 1:** If I knew it was an autonomous system with a safety operator, I would be more focused on observing the road conditions. I might feel a bit more anxious but also more attentive to how the system handles different situations.

**Speaker 2:** Why does autonomous driving make you more attentive?

**Speaker 1:** Because I believe the current AI technology still has limitations. In complex road conditions, I feel the need to be more vigilant.

**Speaker 2:** One last question from a different perspective: When you are a pedestrian, how do you feel about crossing a street without traffic signals?
**Speaker 1:** When you're a pedestrian, how do you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles or car drivers at an intersection without traffic lights? How do you know what they will do next?

**Speaker 2:** You mean when there are no traffic lights, and the car is still there?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly. When you're crossing the street, how do you observe the car?

**Speaker 2:** Well, you definitely look around to see if there are any cars.

**Speaker 1:** And if there is a car, how do you judge the driver's intentions?

**Speaker 2:** I think this question needs some clarification. If we're crossing the street and there's a car approaching, I would observe if the driver has any intention of stopping. If the driver shows signs of slowing down, I might proceed. Otherwise, I would wait.

**Speaker 1:** So, would you choose to rush across, slowly approach and look for an opportunity, or stay put until you're sure it's safe?

**Speaker 2:** I would wait and see if the car slows down significantly. If it does, I would proceed. If not, I would stay put.

**Speaker 1:** Great. We wanted to understand how people react in such situations, especially when considering autonomous vehicles. When you think the car might be self-driving, does your behavior change compared to when you think it's driven by a person?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think the experience might be different. We wanted to know where those differences lie.

**Speaker 1:** Thank you very much for your insights. Your observations are very detailed and helpful.

**Speaker 2:** You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.
