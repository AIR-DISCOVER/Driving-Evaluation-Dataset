**Speaker 1:**
OK, let's start our interview. First, I'll ask some general questions unrelated to our experiment. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, quite often. Especially when I go home or go out with my parents.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long or short trips? How long do they typically last?

**Speaker 2:**
Between 15 minutes to an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about your ride in our vehicle today? Ignoring the weather, how would you rate the driver's skills and the comfort of the vehicle, such as the space?

**Speaker 2:**
The car felt quite old, right? The transition from the information system to the engine wasn't very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean during turns, right? Any other impressions? No? Alright. If you had to choose, what type of car do you prefer? SUVs, gasoline cars, electric cars, or sedans?

**Speaker 2:**
Gasoline cars, usually sedans.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself? How do you rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. I think I drive quite well.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's recall the driving process earlier. It was raining, and the roads were quite busy. Can you remember where you pressed the handle? The weather might have caused some discomfort. Can you speak into the mic to check if I can hear you?

**Speaker 2:**
I can't hear you.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, hold it closer. Now, let me ask you some other questions. How do you rate the driver's skills today?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the driver is skilled, but since he doesn't usually drive this car, there was a slight delay in his reactions.

**Speaker 1:**
We're approaching our first turn, and there are quite a few cars ahead. Did the driver's turning maneuvers give you any particular feelings?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt quite normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Good. We can see there are many cars on both sides and some non-motorized vehicles. When you're in the front passenger seat, do you pay attention to other vehicles like bicycles around you?
**Speaker 1:** There are quite a few vehicles, including some non-motorized ones. When you're sitting in the front passenger seat, do you pay attention to bicycles or other vehicles nearby?

**Speaker 1:** Alright, our car is about to enter the side road ahead.

**Speaker 1:** For instance, here we see a bus driving parallel to us. As a front passenger, do you feel nervous when you see a bus like this while entering a side road?

**Speaker 2:** In that situation, the driver slightly braked to let the bus pass, so I didn't feel nervous. Oh, right, that's good.

**Speaker 1:** If you see a car suddenly cutting in front of you, do you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** In that situation, because we were driving slowly and there was enough space and time, I didn't feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** As a passenger, do you think the driver handled it properly from your perspective?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if the driver reacts the same way I would, I feel good about it. I imagine how I would handle it if I were driving.

**Speaker 1:** This is a long segment, so let's move on to other questions.

**Speaker 1:** From your perspective, what makes a good or professional driver? What qualities or skills should they have?

**Speaker 2:** It mainly depends on whether the driver is confident and not nervous. You could have been driving for 10 years but still get nervous on the highway, or you could be driving for just a month and handle it well.

**Speaker 1:** So it's mainly a matter of mindset, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially in special situations.

**Speaker 1:** I understand. For example, if a car suddenly cuts in, what do you think is the biggest difference between new and experienced drivers based on your standards?

**Speaker 2:** I think...

**Speaker 1:** For example, there will definitely be a difference in skill.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but I think the biggest difference is in their reactions and mindset, especially since driving schools in China are relatively short. Manual transmission courses are 31 days, and automatic ones are 20 days.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, that's the fastest.

**Speaker 2:** So, it mainly depends on how you react on the road and whether you stay calm.

**Speaker 1:** Special reactions on the road. Okay, this U-turn seems to be taking a while. There are indeed quite a few cars today. Did you press the handle? Let me check. Oh, yes, we detected it. What situations make you feel uncomfortable here?

**Speaker 2:** It's because the barrier ends quite early.

**Speaker 1:** The barrier is positioned quite far back, and then...
**Speaker 1:** Are there any situations here that make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's because the barrier ends quite early.

**Speaker 1:** So, the barrier is positioned further back, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, all the cars usually make a U-turn right after the barrier. But our CD class drove up to the zebra crossing before realizing we needed to turn. We didn't react in time.

**Speaker 1:** Did you need to adjust? So, you pressed the button because you didn't realize it in time?

**Speaker 2:** They usually make a U-turn right after the barrier. We didn't realize we needed to turn until we reached the zebra crossing.

**Speaker 1:** So, this sudden need to make a U-turn made you feel uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:** It wasn't sudden; it just felt a bit strange because usually, you would record it as too much.

**Speaker 1:** Maybe it's because of the weather today; the road markings aren't very clear.

**Speaker 1:** This is just a regular stretch of road. How do you feel when driving on such a road? For example, if the speed is steady.

**Speaker 2:** The speed wasn't steady; the driver decided to overtake but didn't manage to.

**Speaker 1:** So, they tried to overtake but couldn't, right?

**Speaker 1:** For instance, with the driver trying to overtake but failing, do you pay special attention to that? Or do you find it strange or uncomfortable during such maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't press the button, but I found it strange because we were about to turn right, and there were many cars on the left. I didn't understand why they wanted to speed up. Oh, but I didn't feel particularly uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't feel particularly uncomfortable to the point of needing to press the handle. From your perspective, you might not see things clearly. For example, if you were in the passenger seat, you could see some non-motorized vehicles on the side road through your window. Would you feel nervous if you saw them?

**Speaker 2:** I would pay attention to them.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, you would pay attention to them as a passenger, right? Okay, I think the rain might reduce the number of non-motorized vehicles on the road. Usually, there are many cars here.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel anything special at the last intersection, or was it just a regular right turn?

**Speaker 2:** The turn was quite wide.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, it was a wide turn. Did that make you feel uncomfortable, or did it create a sense of inertia?

**Speaker 2:** It felt a bit strange, but nothing major. At the last intersection, the traffic light was unclear. I didn't know if it was a straight-only lane or if it had separate lanes for right turns and straight-ahead traffic. It felt like a single lane, but the turn was quite wide.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it seemed like the car moved into the inner lane, right?

**Speaker 1:** For example, on this straight road, do you...
Speaker 1: Hmm, but I felt that the turn was a bit wide.

Speaker 2: Yes, it seemed to veer into the inner lane, right?

Speaker 1: For example, on a straight road like this, can you feel if the driver is maintaining a constant speed or deliberately accelerating? I couldn't quite tell from the video. Do you have any subjective feelings about it?

Speaker 2: Why is that?

Speaker 1: No? It seemed pretty constant. Oh, earlier it did accelerate a bit. We can see here that it looks like a school zone. As a passenger, seeing a school zone with potentially more people and cars, how do you feel? And if you were the driver, how would you react?

Speaker 2: As a passenger, I would be more observant.

Speaker 1: Right, so you like to observe your surroundings when you're not busy, unlike some passengers who completely ignore their surroundings once they get in the car. Is that correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, because as a passenger, I don't play on my phone much. If I do, I get car sick.

Speaker 1: So you have a habit of looking around to avoid car sickness. Did you feel any car sickness today? No? That means the driver's skills are quite good. Very good. Earlier, did you grip the handle? Yes? Did you do it again later? No? There was some data showing you gripped it again. When you see a car merging into our lane, how do you feel? Do you trust the driver, or do you get nervous?

Speaker 2: I trust the driver because he allowed the other car to merge.

Speaker 1: So you feel that the driver has a habit of yielding, which makes you trust him more, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, and I gripped the handle earlier because of the car next to us.

Speaker 1: Right, just now, correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, because when I'm driving or in the front passenger seat, I'm always afraid that someone might open their door without seeing our car.

Speaker 1: Exactly, you're worried they might step out suddenly, right? So earlier, you were concerned that someone might open their door, correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's why I gripped the handle.

Speaker 1: Oh, it wasn't because of the other cars. You trust the driver to handle those, but you're more concerned about pedestrians. So in special situations on the road, you pay more attention to pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles rather than larger vehicles.
**Speaker 1:** You trust the driver's handling, but you're more concerned about pedestrians, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. In special situations on the road, I pay more attention to pedestrians or non-motorized vehicles rather than large vehicles.

**Speaker 1:** So, pedestrians make you more nervous because their actions are unpredictable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, just like the one we saw earlier who suddenly stopped. As a passenger, since you can't control the car, how do you feel during long traffic jams? Do you get impatient or have any particular feelings, or are you okay with it?

**Speaker 2:** If the traffic jam lasts too long, I do get a bit impatient.

**Speaker 1:** So, today's traffic conditions are within your acceptable range?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's not too bad.

**Speaker 1:** For example, if you see a car suddenly reversing at an intersection, do you pay attention to such unusual behaviors?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but since we're not driving very fast, it's not too concerning.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about the driver's braking?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes it's a bit abrupt, but usually, it's okay.

**Speaker 1:** So, there are moments when the driver brakes suddenly, making you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** It's not really about sudden braking; it's more about the driver not being used to the car, which makes the braking feel abrupt.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think it's more about getting used to the car rather than the driver's skill?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Do you believe the driver can handle the car well because they drive slowly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** Let's talk about something else. What do you think are the limitations of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I think the reaction time is a major limitation. For example, in Europe, they often test how quickly a car can react to unexpected situations, like suddenly needing to change lanes.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mean how quickly the car can respond to special situations?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think autonomous driving struggles with sudden, urgent situations.

**Speaker 1:** It's difficult for autonomous systems to handle sudden obstacles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because autonomous driving systems aren't as quick to react in emergencies.
**Speaker 1:**
In urgent situations, it's really difficult to handle sudden obstacles.

**Speaker 2:**
I think because autonomous driving lacks its own thinking ability, for example, at some ETC exits, they split into a left and a right lane. Autonomous driving systems don't consider which lane to take next; they just choose the most convenient exit. If it needs to immediately switch to the right lane, it would be quite difficult for it to do so.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, making a sudden and significant change is challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
Wow, there are so many cars. If I asked you to judge whether the car we just saw was driven by a human or an autonomous system, what would you say?

**Speaker 2:**
I think you can tell, especially just before it turned onto the previous road. It made a significant acceleration while turning.

**Speaker 1:**
It accelerated while turning?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it overtook another car before turning.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, right, I remember now.

**Speaker 2:**
An autonomous system wouldn't do that. It wouldn't know to overtake before turning.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if the car you were just in was actually on autonomous mode, with the driver just acting as a safety officer, what differences did you notice compared to your usual experience? Were there any details that made you feel it might not be a human driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes, it maintains a distance that feels too large, like just before the U-turn at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think autonomous driving systems deliberately keep a larger distance from other cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it feels overly cautious, making it seem less human.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. Earlier, we were stuck in traffic near a school, possibly a kindergarten. There were a lot of people, and the road was narrow. As a passenger, how did you feel about that situation?

**Speaker 2:**
You could guess it was a school or something similar.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you could guess. It felt unavoidable with so many people around.

**Speaker 2:**
Regardless of the weather, it would be particularly challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, because of the weather.

**Speaker 2:**
No, I mean, regardless of the weather.

**Speaker 1:**
Regardless of the weather, it would be challenging.
Speaker 1:
Alright.

Speaker 2:
But the weather can be quite unpredictable.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly because of this kind of weather.

Speaker 2:
Well, no, I mean regardless of the weather.

Speaker 1:
Regardless of the weather, yes.

Speaker 2:
It can always be like this.

Speaker 1:
So, this scenario is quite acceptable, with a high level of acceptance. For you, we need to make a left turn ahead. Actually, we can see that these intersections don't have traffic lights. For example, if you encounter such intersections without traffic lights, from a passenger's perspective, or mixing in some of your driving experience, how would you feel? Do you have any special feelings as a passenger in such situations?

Speaker 2:
I would mostly just look around at the surrounding cars, but I feel like on such roads, there wouldn't be too many cars.

Speaker 1:
Small intersections, right?

Speaker 2:
Small intersections? Yes, I think not having traffic lights isn't a big deal.

Speaker 1:
It's not a big problem, right? For small intersections, it's manageable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and this road only allows traffic in one direction.

Speaker 1:
No, that's not the case. It might just be that there are no cars at the moment.

Speaker 1:
For example, just now there was a bicycle, and we could see that the car was very close to it. As a passenger, you might have noticed it was even closer to you. When you see such non-motorized vehicles passing by so closely, do you have any special feelings?

Speaker 2:
I think my main concern would be if there was a minor accident, like a small scrape.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it's not a big deal, just a small scrape.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's not a big problem. The issue is that it doesn't feel like anyone would get seriously hurt.

Speaker 1:
So, you don't feel nervous. When vehicles pass by closely, you generally don't feel it has a big impact.

Speaker 2:
And I think such situations are unavoidable.

Speaker 1:
Unavoidable, yes. The driver is driving quite smoothly on this stretch of road, right? Oh, we see the car in front suddenly braking and pulling over. It seems like the car in front is constantly braking and moving slowly, right? So, our car is just following along without any intention to overtake. Now, we need to make a right turn here. Actually, as you mentioned earlier, the previous intersection was a small one without traffic lights, which was fine. But now we see this is a larger intersection without traffic lights. Would you feel nervous in advance in such a situation, or not?

Speaker 2:
When we pass through this larger intersection, I might feel a bit more anxious.

Speaker 1:
You would feel nervous.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would be more observant of the surrounding cars and be more cautious.
**Speaker 1:**  
You also felt nervous.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, a bit nervous, but I would observe the cars around me more closely and then proceed.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, even as a passenger, you make a conscious effort to observe, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, and we are turning right here.

**Speaker 1:**  
Okay, so turning right, you don't have to cross other cars. You usually don't pay much attention to right turns, do you?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I don't pay much attention to them.

**Speaker 1:**  
But you feel that right turns are generally safer compared to left turns, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, that's correct. Our driver seems to be following the rules quite well. I noticed a car turning right just now, using the bike lane. Do you think this behavior is acceptable?

**Speaker 2:**  
I think it's fine as long as it doesn't affect the cyclists and there are no cameras.

**Speaker 1:**  
Oh, so if there are no cameras, the driver waits for a while and then proceeds, right? Otherwise, with a lot of cars, many might follow this behavior due to a herd mentality. Do you think it's okay for a car to use the bike lane at this intersection?

**Speaker 2:**  
As long as it doesn't affect the cyclists, it's fine. But if the driver has been waiting for a long time and suddenly changes lanes, it seems unnecessary.

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, if they've been waiting for a long time and then suddenly change lanes, it seems unnecessary.

**Speaker 2:**  
And from the video, we can see that after switching to the bike lane, the light turned green in just 5 seconds.

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:**  
We need to turn right here.

**Speaker 1:**  
In such situations, I tend to be more attentive.

**Speaker 2:**  
Why is that?

**Speaker 1:**  
Because this crosswalk is often used by cyclists who don't pay much attention to the cars around them.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, they only focus on crossing and not on the cars around them.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, the cars need to be more cautious and watch out for them.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly. It seems there aren't many cars ahead.

**Speaker 1:**  
I accidentally pressed the handle just now.

**Speaker 2:**  
It seems like it happened recently, but I'm not sure because the timeline isn't clear. When you press the handle, do you press it all the way down?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, if you don't press it all the way, it might not work properly.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, pressing it all the way is more effective. We just turned at the previous intersection.
**Speaker 1:** Is it the kind of situation where you press the pedal all the way down?

**Speaker 2:** If you didn't press it all the way down, it should be fine.

**Speaker 1:** Right, because pressing it all the way down is quite noticeable. We just turned at the intersection smoothly. For instance, if we see a vehicle ahead, but there's a truck blocking the way, and the driver decides to accelerate and overtake the truck, how do you feel about such a situation? Especially when there are cars on both sides, do you think it's reasonable?

**Speaker 2:** If the cars on the left and right are close to us, I would feel a bit uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** You think it's unnecessary. From your perspective, if the cars are far enough, do you feel the driver can safely pass through?

**Speaker 2:** If they are closer, I would think it's unnecessary to overtake.

**Speaker 1:** So, you would prefer to wait a bit?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially if the road ahead is clear.

**Speaker 1:** Right. Did the driver accelerate on this clear stretch of road?

**Speaker 2:** No, the driving was quite steady.

**Speaker 1:** We're approaching another intersection. Did you press the handle here? You pressed it twice, but there might have been an accidental press once. Now, there are more cars compared to earlier.

**Speaker 1:** At such intersections, when there are many cars in both directions, how do you feel?

**Speaker 2:** I feel a bit uneasy, but I think the driver's behavior is a bit unnecessary.

**Speaker 1:** You mean the driver trying to overtake at the intersection is not appropriate?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because if the car in front suddenly stops, it would be troublesome to handle.

**Speaker 1:** You mean the oncoming traffic, right? Because it occupies the lane. Okay, there are cars coming from all directions. How do you feel when you see cars coming from all sides and you can't move forward?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel uncomfortable because our driver didn't force his way in.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, the driver yielded, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he yielded a bit.

**Speaker 1:** He didn't rush in but moved slowly. Do you think the driver's handling was good?

**Speaker 2:** It's okay. If it were you, what would you do?

**Speaker 1:** I would wait a bit.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.
**Speaker 1:** When you see a driver trying to park in a large space, do you think their handling of the situation is good?

**Speaker 2:** It's okay. If it were you, how would you handle it?

**Speaker 1:** I would wait a bit first, then move slowly. Actually, it went quite smoothly at the intersection just now, but the way the driver overtook earlier didn't feel great. The green light allowed us to pass directly.

**Speaker 1:** As a passenger, do you sometimes pay attention to whether the driver is following traffic rules or their driving behavior?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:** For example, if a driver has a clear intention to overtake at an intersection, would your trust in the driver decrease?

**Speaker 2:** No, I would still trust them. We need to turn right here, and there seem to be quite a few cars. Maybe because of the rain, there are fewer non-motorized vehicles. Here, we need to change lanes. We can't see the full view, but we can see the car behind us. If the car turns right and directly moves to the innermost lane, it's not very reasonable, right? But since there are no cars behind, it's okay. If you see no cars behind, would you feel particularly concerned if the driver directly turns into the innermost lane?

**Speaker 2:** It's safe.

**Speaker 1:** So, in the scenario just now, you could accept it because there were no cars behind, so the driver turning directly into the innermost lane was fine?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's correct. All the other cars were in the outer lane.

**Speaker 1:** Our trust in the driver would decrease if they mishandle basic or easy situations, causing accidents or making us nervous.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. I value the driver's mindset and communication. For example, the situation just now was basic. I want to know what you consider basic driving behaviors or situations.

**Speaker 2:** That situation can be considered basic, like the intersection we just passed.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, those are basic situations. I think they are special and precise.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they are special.

**Speaker 1:** For example, dealing with pedestrians or making turns should be basic skills that a driver should have. So, you think the driver handled these basic situations well today and didn't make you lose trust in them?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, except for the U-turn where they drove onto the sidewalk.

**Speaker 1:** Is the traffic ahead congested again?

**Speaker 2:** Not for too long, but we did wait for a while.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, about that U-turn...

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was.

**Speaker 1:** Actually, our trip is almost over. Let me ask you some other questions. Can you recall any situations outside the car during your usual rides that made you feel particularly scared or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** When someone opens the door suddenly.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, when someone opens the door...
**Speaker 1:** Can you recall any experiences while riding in a car where you felt particularly scared or unsafe due to external factors?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when a car door suddenly opens.

**Speaker 1:** Right, when a car door suddenly opens. That's an external factor. Are there any internal factors inside the car that make you feel unsafe? For example, does the driver's behavior ever make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** I don't think so.

**Speaker 1:** You don't think so?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, unless there's a special situation, like an emergency brake or a very sharp turn. That might make me feel a bit unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** So, sudden actions like emergency braking or sharp turns can make you feel unsafe.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but if those sudden actions are handled properly, they wouldn't affect my confidence in the driver.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Earlier, I made a U-turn, and it seemed to go smoothly because the left turn light was green. It felt quite seamless, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was smooth, without any particular feeling of discomfort.

**Speaker 1:** We're about to return to the parking lot. For instance, earlier we encountered some non-motorized vehicles. They were traveling in the opposite direction to us. As a passenger, do you pay special attention to them, or do they affect you in any way?

**Speaker 2:** I actually pay more attention to the vehicles moving in the same direction as us.

**Speaker 1:** The ones moving parallel to us, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because they don't have any restrictions.

**Speaker 1:** So, you focus on the non-motorized vehicles behind us?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if they suddenly turn, they might not notice us.

**Speaker 1:** So, you also pay attention to them because they might not notice you.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but if they are going the wrong way, they can see us, so it's not very dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Even though what they're doing is wrong, you don't worry too much about them.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I don't focus on them as much.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, we're almost back. There shouldn't be anything special now. Let me check if there are any other questions.

**Speaker 1:** Do you often drive yourself? If so, do you have any bad driving habits that you think might be dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** I like to get close to the car in front of me at traffic lights.

**Speaker 1:** So, you follow the car in front very closely?

**Speaker 2:** Especially at traffic lights, I like to...
**Speaker 1:**  
When you're at a traffic light, you tend to stay close to the car in front, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, especially at traffic lights. If I'm the first car, I tend to accelerate quickly when the light turns green.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you make a rapid start. Got it. Now, let's talk about safety. What behaviors do you find unsafe, either as a driver or a passenger? What actions by other drivers make you feel uncomfortable or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**  
I always consider the driver's experience first. For example, when taking a taxi, I think about how long the driver has been driving.

**Speaker 1:**  
Do you find taxi rides more comfortable compared to other ride services?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I usually prefer taxis over ride-hailing services because I feel that taxi drivers drive more steadily.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, taxi drivers make you feel more secure because they don't accelerate or brake suddenly, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Exactly. Sudden acceleration or braking makes me uncomfortable. Taxi drivers tend to drive more smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**  
And ride-hailing drivers often don't focus on passenger comfort, correct? Do you have any driving habits that might make your passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I've been told that my braking can be too abrupt and that I follow other cars too closely.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you've received feedback that your driving makes others uncomfortable. Do you feel uncomfortable as a passenger when the driver follows too closely?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I do. I prefer a bit more distance between cars.

**Speaker 1:**  
You feel there's no need to follow so closely, right? Now, let's talk about intersections without traffic lights. How do you judge the intentions of other vehicles and cyclists when you're driving through such intersections?

**Speaker 2:**  
When there are fewer cars, I slow down and make sure to look around carefully to understand the intentions of other road users.
**Speaker 1:**
From your perspective, how do you judge the intentions of other vehicles? When there are fewer cars, you can analyze each one.

**Speaker 2:**
When there are fewer cars, I usually slow down and look around to check for any non-motorized vehicles or other motor vehicles. If there are more cars, you need to brake and assess the situation carefully. Does that make sense?

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you judge the intentions, you first slow down. But depending on the road conditions, you either slow down or come to a complete stop, right? Okay, let's take another example. For instance, when making a left turn, if you want to cross in front of an oncoming vehicle, would you move slowly, stop, or quickly find a gap and go through?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it depends on the car in the left lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, you mean if...

**Speaker 2:**
If the car is far enough away, I wouldn't slow down. I would just go ahead and pass the car on my right.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you judge whether you can make it through, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if I can judge that I can make it through, I prefer to go directly.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, that makes sense. Well, that about wraps up our questions for today. Thank you for taking the time for this interview.

**Speaker 2:**
You're welcome. I'll stop the recording now.
