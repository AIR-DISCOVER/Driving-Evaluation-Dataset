**Speaker 1:** Wait.

**Speaker 1:** Quickly press the button on your hand.

**Speaker 2:** OK, let's start our interview. Sorry for the wait. First, let's go through some simple, everyday questions. Do you often travel by car? How frequently?

**Speaker 2:** Hmm, I usually take ride-hailing services or taxis. Is it usually long-distance or short-distance? And how long do these trips typically last? Oh, generally, it's short-distance, about half an hour or so. The second question is, how did you feel about today's ride? Any impressions or thoughts you'd like to share?

**Speaker 2:** The braking felt a bit hard.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed that too. It felt a bit abrupt at times.

**Speaker 2:** How would you rate the driver's skills today? Any specific observations?

**Speaker 1:** The driver was good at navigating through traffic and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles, especially during turns and in heavy traffic.

**Speaker 2:** We might highlight some of these points in the video. The third question is, if you had a choice, what type of car do you prefer for travel? For example, an SUV, an off-road vehicle, a gasoline car, or an electric car?

**Speaker 1:** I prefer gasoline cars. They seem more reliable and stable, especially for longer trips.

**Speaker 1:** Even in heavy traffic, they perform well and feel more stable.

**Speaker 2:** So, you feel that gasoline cars are more mature in terms of hardware and provide a smoother ride?

**Speaker 2:** As a driver, you prefer gasoline cars. But if you were a passenger, like taking an autonomous vehicle, what type would you choose?

**Speaker 1:** Probably the same, a gasoline car.

**Speaker 2:** Do you drive yourself? How would you rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:** Haha, got it. How often do you drive?

**Speaker 2:** And the distance? I'll note that down.

**Speaker 1:** Understood.

**Speaker 2:** That's about it for the warm-up questions. If you have anything else you'd like to add, feel free to share. Now, let's move on to the next part.
Speaker 1:
Then take a look. Hmm, the warm-up questions are about this much. If you have anything you want to say, feel free to express it openly. Next, we will watch the video, and I will ask you questions as we go along. This is the perspective from when you were in the car. Of course, it might not capture the sounds you heard from your perspective, as it might be through the computer.

Speaker 2:
Sure, but don't worry about that. I remember this was just when we were starting. Did you notice that the driver tried to start the car but then stopped? How did you feel about that? Any impressions? Was it okay? Actually, there was nothing wrong, right? Understood.

Speaker 1:
Yes, but before going to Ningxia, the driver had already test-driven the car and was familiar with it for some time.

Speaker 2:
Right. This microphone might pick up some noise. This is the parking lot. If at any point while watching the video you feel uncomfortable or think there were any safety concerns during the ride, feel free to let me know.

Speaker 1:
The speed of the car was relatively slow today. How did you feel about the driver's speed in this type of vehicle?

Speaker 2:
Are you referring to...? We can discuss this issue after the interview.

Speaker 1:
Now, the driver is making the first right turn after leaving the parking lot. How did you feel during this turn? No specific memories? You mentioned the car or the driver earlier. You can bring up anything that comes to mind. For instance, when two bicycles passed by, how did you feel? Or when a car was driving against traffic, do you remember anything about that?

Speaker 2:
No, I don't remember. I think on this road, there wasn't much to note.

Speaker 1:
Understood. From your perspective in the back seat, when the driver moved from the side road to the main road, how did you feel?

Speaker 2:
It wasn't a problem.

Speaker 1:
Did the presence of large vehicles like buses affect you on the main road? This road is considered a main route.

Speaker 2:
That side is a green zone, understood. There wasn't much to note.

Speaker 1:
From a passenger's perspective, there might be a slight sense of pressure. We might need to move the microphone a bit closer as it's not picking up sound well.

Speaker 2:
Sure, no problem.

Speaker 1:
Thank you, sorry about that. How did the distance to the car in front affect you as a passenger?

Speaker 2:
Around this position, I noticed you slightly pressed the handle. Do you remember that? Maybe you accidentally touched it? How did the congested road affect your mood or comfort? What were your feelings about that?
**Speaker 1:** Do you remember the time when we encountered heavy traffic? How did it affect your mood and comfort?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I remember. When stuck in traffic, what do you usually do to pass the time?

**Speaker 1:** Well, there are usually a lot of cars. Sometimes I switch to a different radio station or listen to music. It helps to pass the time. What about you?

**Speaker 2:** I often find myself adjusting the air conditioning or checking my phone. But when the driver makes a sudden U-turn, how do you feel about that?

**Speaker 1:** It can be a bit unsettling, especially if it's unexpected. It makes me more alert and cautious.

**Speaker 2:** Do you think the frequency of such maneuvers affects your overall comfort during the ride?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, definitely. If the driver frequently makes sudden moves, it can make the ride feel less smooth and more stressful.

**Speaker 2:** Can you recall any specific instances where you felt particularly uncomfortable or unsafe?

**Speaker 1:** There was a time when the driver had to brake suddenly to avoid another car. It was quite jarring and made me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 2:** Do you think the driver handled the situation well?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the driver was cautious and managed to avoid a collision. It showed good reflexes and awareness.

**Speaker 2:** How do you feel about right turns, especially when there are pedestrians around?

**Speaker 1:** Right turns can be tricky. If the driver is careful and checks for pedestrians, it feels safer. But if they rush, it can be nerve-wracking.

**Speaker 2:** What about driving in the rain? Does it make you more anxious?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, rainy conditions definitely add to the anxiety. The roads are slippery, and visibility is reduced, so I tend to be more on edge.

**Speaker 2:** When you're a passenger, do you worry about other vehicles or pedestrians at intersections?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I always keep an eye out for other cars and pedestrians. It's important to be aware of your surroundings, especially at busy intersections.
**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger and you approach an intersection like this, do you worry about people or vehicles coming from the sides, like motorcycles or delivery scooters?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for example, there was a delivery person just now. Did you notice them, or were you aware of the situation around you at that moment?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I did notice. When I'm in such situations, I instinctively put myself in the driver's shoes to assess the details.

**Speaker 2:** Do you think this kind of awareness helps in making better decisions, especially when dealing with non-motorized vehicles? The road is quite narrow, and there are people and cars around.

**Speaker 1:** Absolutely. I pay special attention to these concerns. When dealing with multi-lane roads and preparing for various situations, it's important to be vigilant.

**Speaker 2:** As a driver, do you also notice these situations and feel a bit anxious?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, especially when there are non-motorized vehicles around. I remember specific moments when I had to be extra cautious.

**Speaker 2:** Do you feel more at ease or more tense when the road clears up a bit, like when picking up children from school?

**Speaker 1:** I feel a bit more at ease when the road is clear, but I still remain cautious.

**Speaker 2:** How do you evaluate the behavior of other drivers in such situations? Do you think they handle it well?

**Speaker 1:** Generally, I think they handle it quite well. However, traffic in Beijing can be very congested, and many roads are like this.

**Speaker 2:** Do you feel any discomfort or hesitation in such traffic conditions?

**Speaker 1:** Sometimes, yes. It can be a bit uncomfortable, but it's manageable.

**Speaker 2:** During your journey, do you pay attention to the intersections and the conditions around them?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I do. I always keep an eye on the intersections and the surrounding conditions to ensure safety.

**Speaker 2:** How do you feel about the stability of the ride in such conditions?

**Speaker 1:** The stability can be a bit unpredictable, especially on narrow and crowded roads.

**Speaker 2:** And what about left turns on narrow roads with lots of cars?

**Speaker 1:** Those can be quite challenging and require extra caution.
**Speaker 1:**
So, how would you evaluate the driver's left turn here? The road is quite narrow and full of cars. Considering it was raining and the road is relatively wide, what was your impression? How did you feel about the driver's speed and driving style?

**Speaker 2:**
I understand. There was also a delivery truck here. How did you feel about that? It seemed quite common. We also passed through an intersection without traffic lights. What was your impression of the turn at that intersection?

**Speaker 1:**
I prefer electric cars for their smoothness compared to gasoline cars.

**Speaker 2:**
I see. The cars coming from both sides didn't seem to bother you. What are your thoughts on that?

**Speaker 1:**
We also passed a main road with traffic lights and someone crossed the road. How did you feel about that? Did you notice the speed or the acceleration on this open stretch of road?

**Speaker 2:**
From the video, it didn't seem too far. What was the situation like at that moment?

**Speaker 1:**
There was a bit of a delay.

**Speaker 2:**
There was also a turn here. How did you feel about the driving behavior on this road compared to the one near the kindergarten? How was your experience as a passenger? Was it comfortable? How do you think the driver should drive to make it comfortable or acceptable for you?

**Speaker 1:**
The behavior was okay.

**Speaker 2:**
How did you feel about the stretch of road after the right turn? It was quite narrow and there were many oncoming vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
What specific behaviors or conditions on this road made you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
It might be the way cars occupy their lanes. This behavior can make you subconsciously alert. What do you think could happen in such situations? How should a driver respond to these conditions? Considering the parked cars, people with umbrellas, and electric scooters, and the lack of clear dividers, what should the driver do to make you feel comfortable and avoid discomfort?
**Speaker 1:** How do you think a driver should behave in situations where there are no clear lanes or barriers, to make you feel comfortable and avoid any discomfort?

**Speaker 2:** Well, the driver should give reminders and maybe be a bit more cautious. For example, if there's a right turn coming up, they should let you know. How do you feel about that?

**Speaker 1:** I think that's a good approach. If there's a car that hasn't turned off its engine, the driver should proceed carefully and follow the rules. Do you agree?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. How slow do you think the driver should go when passing a car that hasn't turned off its engine?

**Speaker 1:** It depends. If there aren't many people around, it's better to go a bit faster. But if there are a lot of people, it's safer to go slower.

**Speaker 2:** There are also more cars around. How do you feel when you pass through an intersection without traffic lights and the number of cars has doubled?

**Speaker 1:** It can be a bit stressful. How do you evaluate the driver's behavior in such situations?

**Speaker 2:** From a passenger's perspective, would you prefer the driver to be more aggressive or more cautious in these situations without traffic lights and with many cars around? Do you accept or encourage the driver's behavior in such cases?

**Speaker 1:** I think the driver should find a balance, not too aggressive but not too slow either.

**Speaker 2:** So, you find the driver's left turns acceptable?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the series of left turns were fine.

**Speaker 2:** Earlier, there was a car in front of us. How did you feel about that? Did you feel more concerned when the car was closer to you?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the closer the car, the more cautious I felt. Especially on rainy days when many cars stop by the roadside, do you think the speed was appropriate? How did you feel about the right turn we just made? Did you feel any discomfort or safety concerns?

**Speaker 2:** The ride felt smooth and steady. The car maintained a consistent speed and safe distance.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it was very smooth. What do you think contributed to that smoothness?

**Speaker 2:** The consistent speed and maintaining a safe distance between cars.

**Speaker 1:** The road was narrow, but the car's wheelbase seemed normal. We watched a video, and I have some final questions. Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver during the trip? How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:** If the driver engages in risky behaviors, it makes me feel unsafe. What specific actions make you feel this way?

**Speaker 1:** I understand, especially in tricky situations.

**Speaker 2:** Got it.
**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I feel unsafe, especially if the driver exhibits certain behaviors that make you feel uneasy.

**Speaker 2:**
I understand. Can you recall any specific situations outside the vehicle that made you feel particularly scared or unsafe while riding? For example, when a bus is pulling out of a station.

**Speaker 1:**
Maybe it’s because I feel much smaller and more vulnerable in comparison. What about situations inside the vehicle? Are there any that make you feel particularly afraid?

**Speaker 2:**
As a passenger, for instance, if you see another car cutting in close, or like some passengers we've interviewed before, they might be scared when a large vehicle is very close. How do you feel in such scenarios?

**Speaker 1:**
Even though you're inside a metal shell, you still feel... What actions by the driver make you feel particularly unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel scared even if nothing major happens, just from the driver's anxious behavior.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it's like the anxiety spreads to you, making you feel there's danger. You mentioned you also drive. What bad habits do you think you have while driving that could be dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**
When handling a situation, how do you manage your load or avoid forgetting safe driving practices?

**Speaker 1:**
For example, answering a phone call or dealing with something urgent can lead to unsafe behavior.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and pressing the wrong button or not pressing it at all. Do you think the driver should focus on the passenger's comfort? Did the driver today pay attention to your comfort?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, because the driver could have accelerated but didn't, showing consideration for passenger comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
Hahaha, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

**Speaker 1:**
When you ride in someone else's car, what makes you feel uncomfortable? For example, physical discomfort.

**Speaker 2:**
I think many people overestimate their driving skills, which can affect their judgment.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, overconfidence can be an issue.

**Speaker 2:**
How can drivers make passengers feel safer and avoid such situations?

**Speaker 1:**
By being more predictable and cautious.

**Speaker 2:**
You mentioned you also drive. What bad driving habits do you think you have that might make passengers feel uncomfortable?
**Speaker 1:** Do you drive often? Regarding the previous question, what do you think are some of your bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable? Can you give some examples?

**Speaker 2:** Well, I think sometimes I might brake too suddenly or accelerate too quickly. These actions can make passengers feel uneasy. Also, I might not always signal when changing lanes, which can be unsettling for others in the car.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a good driver? How would you define a professional or experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:** A good driver is someone who drives smoothly and predictably, making passengers feel safe and comfortable. They should be able to handle different road conditions well and be aware of their surroundings at all times.

**Speaker 1:** Let's assume you're in a self-driving car. What would make you feel that it's driving professionally? Why?

**Speaker 2:** If the car can handle complex road situations smoothly and make decisions like a human driver, that would make me feel it's professional. Sometimes, even humans find it hard to judge certain road conditions, so if a machine can do it well, that's impressive.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the core issue is how well it can adapt. If it's too rigid with the rules, it might not be as comfortable or safe.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. A good balance between following rules and being flexible is important. For instance, in safe conditions, a bit of flexibility can make the ride smoother and less risky. What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a new driver?

**Speaker 1:** Experienced drivers have a better understanding of their vehicle and how to maintain it. They also tend to make passengers feel more comfortable because they drive more smoothly and predictably.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the way they handle the car and their knowledge of its maintenance are key differences. What aspects do you think self-driving cars will never be able to match human drivers in?

**Speaker 1:** For example, parking. Humans can often find creative solutions in tight spots that a machine might not be able to.

**Speaker 2:** Right, and in situations where quick judgment is needed, humans can be more assertive in claiming road space or adjusting speed. Are there other areas where you think self-driving cars fall short compared to experienced human drivers?

**Speaker 1:** Acceptance and trust in the technology are also factors. People might not feel as comfortable with a machine making all the decisions.

**Speaker 2:** True, and each person has their own preferences and comfort levels. When you were in the car earlier, did you feel like it was driven by a human or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 1:** Sometimes it felt like a human was driving, especially during maneuvers like U-turns. But other times, it felt more like a machine due to the precision and consistency.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there were moments when it seemed like a human was in control, especially during certain turns.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly, like the first U-turn we took.
**Speaker 1:**
I feel like my thoughts are the same, haha.

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes it feels like it's you.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, the first U-turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Who do you think was driving during the U-turn?

**Speaker 1:**
Xiu Tong? It should be continuing, hmm.

**Speaker 2:**
Where do you think the driver was accelerating quickly?

**Speaker 2:**
How do you judge whether it's autonomous driving or a human driver? What's your criteria?

**Speaker 1:**
If we talk about the last U-turn...

**Speaker 2:**
Haha, okay. So, what's your judgment criteria? Do you think autonomous driving is safer and smoother, while human drivers are more aggressive? Or do you have your own criteria?

**Speaker 1:**
It can be understood as the same condition?

**Speaker 1:**
A left turn at a green light is more predictable, but the first U-turn must follow the U-turn rules.

**Speaker 2:**
Who do you think was driving?

**Speaker 1:**
It was the machine. And the last U-turn from over 100 meters away was clearly...

**Speaker 2:**
Could it be related to the traffic flow? Because there were quite a few cars during the U-turn, and the final merge into the side road was similar.

**Speaker 1:**
For a U-turn, if it's related to traffic flow, when there are many fast-moving cars, you should start the U-turn from a greater distance rather than getting too close to the oncoming cars, which shortens your U-turn distance. This approach is incorrect, haha.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay, hmm. Based on your judgment, some parts might have been autonomous driving, and some parts might have been driven by a human. How do these experiences differ from your usual car rides? You take quite a few rides every week, usually for about half an hour.

**Speaker 2:**
Whether it was autonomous driving or a human driver, what differences did you notice in the experience?

**Speaker 2:**
You could see the driver's perspective, right? What details made you feel it wasn't a real driver? Was it the turns or other aspects? If it was too far or too thin, it didn't feel like a human driver.

**Speaker 1:**
If you push forward freely...

**Speaker 2:**
A small model.

**Speaker 2:**
Lastly, if you were a pedestrian, how would you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles and drivers at an intersection without traffic lights? How would you decide whether to cross the road? This might be a bit of a leap, but it offers a different perspective. Imagine yourself as a pedestrian or a vehicle on that busy road.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you watch if the car is inching forward, like we do?
**Speaker 1:**  
Let's change the perspective. Imagine you're a pedestrian or another vehicle on a busy road. How would you react?

**Speaker 2:**  
I would watch if the cars are trying to push forward, just like we do.

**Speaker 1:**  
What if a car is approaching you?

**Speaker 2:**  
Even if the car is slowly moving forward, if I feel I can move faster, I would go ahead. Is that what you mean? Are there other criteria for judging the intent of the driver? Would you interact directly with the driver, or would you just proceed regardless of the car's movement? How would you handle it?

**Speaker 1:**  
I think I would have some criteria. Hmm, let's start.

**Speaker 2:**  
Do you think there would be a danger? What do you consider a dangerous distance? Approximately how far would that be?

**Speaker 1:**  
I think it would be around 30 to 40 meters. That's the distance where I would start to feel it's dangerous.

**Speaker 2:**  
Alright, I see. Thank you for your answers. It's getting late, and I apologize for that. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Considering safety, we always have the driver in control.

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, it doesn't really concern me directly.

**Speaker 2:**  
We have a form here. It's quite straightforward.

**Speaker 1:**  
I agree, haha.

**Speaker 2:**  
We are conducting a formal experiment. We will provide the information in a structured manner. If you don't remember everything, it's okay. You can add me on WeChat to set up an account and get more details.
