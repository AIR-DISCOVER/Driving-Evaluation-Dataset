**Speaker 1:**
I hope you don't mind, I might need to adjust this microphone. Alright, so we're leaving the parking lot now. If at any point during the video you feel uncomfortable or sense any safety concerns, please let me know, and we can stop. Is the speed of the car okay for you today? Do you think the driver's speed is acceptable?

**Speaker 2:**
So, are we evaluating the car or the driver?

**Speaker 1:**
We're focusing on the driver.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright, I understand.

**Speaker 1:**
We can discuss more after the interview. Now, the driver has just made the first right turn after leaving the parking lot. How do you feel about that turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't have any specific memories or feelings about it. It didn't stand out to me.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned earlier about the car or the driver. For instance, when a bicycle passed by, how did you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
I couldn't see it very well from my side.

**Speaker 1:**
We just passed a car going the wrong way. Did you notice that or have any feelings about it?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't really notice. I think this road is quite wide, especially if there are no parked cars on the right side. Even with bicycles or electric scooters passing by quickly, I don't feel a significant sense of pressure. It feels relatively safe to me.

**Speaker 1:**
The driver has now moved from the side road to the main road. How do you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
Since I also drive, when entering such roads, I instinctively check the rearview mirror and the side mirrors to see the traffic situation. As a passenger with driving experience, I can anticipate the road conditions. So, whether there are cars coming from behind or not, I don't feel overly tense or uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about large vehicles like buses or trucks?

**Speaker 2:**
On narrow roads, they can make me feel a bit pressured.

**Speaker 1:**
Now we're on the main road.

**Speaker 2:**
What do you mean by the main road?

**Speaker 1:**
I mean this road we're on now.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, the main road. Yes, some main roads are wider.
**Speaker 1:**
Sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming.

**Speaker 2:**
What do you mean by the main road?

**Speaker 1:**
Well, just this road we're on now.

**Speaker 2:**
So, the main road can be wider or narrower. This one has a green median on one side and a fence on the other. On roads like this, you can't really avoid anything. Unlike some roads where there are no pedestrians and you can slightly cross the line to give way, here it feels too close and a bit overwhelming.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, from a passenger's perspective, it can feel a bit pressing.

**Speaker 1:**
We might need to move the microphone a bit closer. His voice isn't very clear.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, he's quite tense.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, indeed. I'll hold it. I can manage. Thank you. Sorry about that. No problem. For instance, the distance to the car in front can affect a passenger's comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
It's better in the back seat.

**Speaker 1:**
Around this position, I noticed you were gripping the handle a bit. Was that intentional?

**Speaker 2:**
I might have touched it accidentally.

**Speaker 1:**
How does traffic congestion affect your mood or comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's just a short stretch, it's fine. But if it lasts more than 8 minutes, I start to feel bored and restless.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you usually do when stuck in traffic?

**Speaker 2:**
I listen to music or audiobooks. I have quite a few in the car.

**Speaker 1:**
We might need to switch microphones.

**Speaker 2:**
Is it that bad?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, they might not be able to hear you clearly. For example, during a U-turn, how do you feel about the driver's maneuver?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt a bit awkward. If the driver is new to this road and hasn't made a U-turn here before, I understand they might need more space to turn smoothly. But if the driver is familiar with the area, the U-turn seemed a bit clumsy. It could also be that the driver was being cautious because there were many passengers, trying to avoid discomfort. But it felt a bit too slow.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it just the speed, or the frequency of adjustments?

**Speaker 2:**
It was the frequency. It felt like the driver took too long between accelerating, braking, shifting gears, and reversing.
**Speaker 1:**  
Do you often encounter this situation?  
**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it's like when I need to make a turn, I might accelerate. But between braking, shifting gears, and reversing, it feels like there's a bit of a delay, and it's not very smooth.  
**Speaker 1:**  
I see. It feels like the driver is always reacting and thinking, but you don't know what they're thinking about.  
**Speaker 2:**  
Exactly.

**Speaker 1:**  
Can you recall any specific sections of the road where you had to use the handle?  
**Speaker 2:**  
I didn't use it. Overall, it felt quite comfortable.  
**Speaker 1:**  
How do you feel about behaviors like cutting in front of your car?  
**Speaker 2:**  
As a passenger, I would feel that the driver is a bit reckless. What do you think the driver should do in such situations?

**Speaker 2:**  
I think if a car wants to cut in front of me and successfully does so without my driver needing to slow down, it means the distance between my car and the car in front is quite large. This suggests that my driver is cautious, maintaining a safe distance for emergency braking. However, if my driver has to brake when a car cuts in, I might feel that the car cutting in is at fault.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, if the car cuts in smoothly, it means the driver is cautious and maintains a safe distance.  
**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**  
Got it, got it. Haha. Now, there was a right turn just now, and there were some pedestrians on the road. How did you feel about that?  
**Speaker 2:**  
Oh, about that overtaking maneuver. I think the driver handled it quite smoothly. The car in front was clearly slowing down or looking for a parking spot, but it didn't move to the side to let others pass. The driver judged that the car wasn't going to continue in the normal lane and decided to overtake and accelerate.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you think the driver made a wise decision with that overtaking maneuver?  
**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it was a smart move.

**Speaker 1:**  
I understand. In rainy weather, how do you feel about oncoming traffic?  
**Speaker 2:**  
I feel that many electric cars have headlights that are quite uncomfortable, especially in the rain. The glare can be quite disturbing.

**Speaker 1:**  
There's another right turn here. How do you feel about it?
**Speaker 1:** Many electric car lights are indeed quite uncomfortable, especially in the rain when they create a glare. It can be quite bothersome.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there's also a right turn here. How do you feel about this right turn, in terms of overall experience or any specific aspects? 

**Speaker 1:** It feels normal. When you're a passenger at such intersections, do you worry about pedestrians or other vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:** Earlier, there was a delivery person. Did you notice them, or as a passenger, how did you react?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I noticed. In such situations, it's important to yield to them. The driver, being in the front seat, can accurately judge the distance and decide whether to slow down or continue driving normally. As a backseat passenger, it can be a bit tense because I can't see the distance clearly. This was my first time in this car, so I wasn't familiar with the front end's length.

**Speaker 1:** So, you instinctively try to judge the situation as if you were the driver?

**Speaker 2:** Not exactly. It's more about feeling whether our car might merge into the oncoming lane or if there might be a collision. It's not exactly tension, but a concern that crosses your mind.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Thank you. Especially from your perspective, how do you feel about these behaviors on narrow roads with pedestrians around?

**Speaker 2:** It can be a bit concerning. On narrow, multi-lane roads with parallel parking, opening car doors can be quite dangerous. Some people don't check for oncoming traffic before opening their doors, which can be sudden and risky.

**Speaker 1:** So, you do notice these situations and feel a bit uneasy, right? 

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially with non-motorized vehicles around. I remember there was a delivery truck, maybe a SF Express truck, on the left or right side.

**Speaker 1:** Was it at the corner, where it seemed like it might turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was at the corner, almost turning. It was in the oncoming lane, not too big, but not small either.
**Speaker 2:**
Oh, it's like this. You see, it's equivalent to driving against traffic in the opposite lane. And this kind of situation, you can't say it's big, but you can't say it's small either. So, with this kind of vehicle size, you have to let it go. In such congested road sections, you don't know how it's going to move. At that time, I felt a bit nervous because it was beyond my ability to control or judge.

**Speaker 1:**
I’ve been waiting here for a while too.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's because the kindergarten up ahead just let out.

**Speaker 1:**
This kind of car is relatively narrow, and there are oncoming cars, and people are squeezing in here. How do you feel as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the driver is quite skilled.

**Speaker 1:**
Impressive, he has a good sense of the distance between cars and the surrounding environment.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he can anticipate changes. For example, there was a car in reverse gear ahead, and the driver made his own judgment because of the reversing lights.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it here or further back? When I pick up my child from school, I usually drive slowly. There are also electric bikes. Does this open space make you feel more at ease or more nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
It doesn't matter much to me. It’s not related to my lane. It's like my car is about to move.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you saying that the car will move soon?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it's parked on the side, similar to the position of this car now.

**Speaker 2:**
Look at this car with the reversing lights on. It's very close. The car next to it is already reversing, but our driver didn't yield.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you evaluate this behavior? Do you think it was appropriate or not?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was fine. The driver was very alert, especially in such narrow and congested road sections. When a parked car tries to join our lane, in today's situation with traffic and rain, as a passenger, I wouldn't want to yield either. According to traffic laws, I am driving normally, so I don't have to yield.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think this behavior is acceptable in this situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's acceptable, but the prerequisite is that the driver's skills are up to par. If the driver can't judge well or maintain proper distance, then they should yield.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like Beijing roads are always congested, many sections are like this.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially near the kindergarten entrance when it rains. Parents quickly leave with their children.
**Speaker 1:**
How was your driving experience today?

**Speaker 2:**
It was alright. You see, this part near the kindergarten was a bit tricky. It was raining, and parents were picking up their kids, so the street was quite busy. But once we passed that area, the traffic eased up. The sudden acceleration after a long pause was a bit uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel a bit of a jolt? How did you find it? Was it comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
It could have been smoother. The driver shouldn't press the accelerator so abruptly. A gradual acceleration would have been better.

**Speaker 1:**
Hold on, this part is still near the kindergarten, right? During the ride, do you pay attention to the entrances and exits along the way? Like here, there's an intersection. Do you notice these situations?

**Speaker 2:**
For intersections like this, not really, because the driver is usually more aware than we are. But I do pay more attention to entrances of residential areas and schools, especially narrow ones where there are more pedestrians and cyclists. 

**Speaker 1:**
Places with a lot of foot traffic and electric bikes, right? You focus more on the people and less on the cars, especially those with less predictable movements.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly, those with less predictable movements.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, there's a left turn, and it's quite narrow and crowded. How would you evaluate the driver's left turn here?

**Speaker 2:**
If there are cars ahead, the driver usually just follows them. 

**Speaker 1:**
Considering the rainy weather and the relatively wide road, how do you feel about the driver's speed and driving style? Any thoughts?

**Speaker 2:**
Earlier, when we were coming out of the Chen De Chang area, the driver kept a good distance from the car in front. The speed was slow, which is understandable since it was a mixed traffic area with bicycles and electric bikes. But on this road, with fewer people and cars, the driver still maintained a large distance. It seems like the driver is cautious at times but can be aggressive with the accelerator.

**Speaker 1:**
What about when you saw the delivery truck? Any thoughts?

**Speaker 2:**
Not much, because the opposite lane was clear, so it was common for the driver to use it to pass the truck.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. That makes sense.
**Speaker 1:**
It seems like you were driving in the opposite lane because there were no cars in the opposite direction. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right. It’s quite common here. We were passing through an intersection with a traffic light. How do you feel about intersections without traffic lights? Were we driving an electric car or a hybrid today?

**Speaker 1:**
I prefer electric cars; they feel more convenient to me.

**Speaker 2:**
Electric cars feel a bit sluggish. When you start, they don't have the same punch as gasoline cars. And when you brake, they feel a bit stiffer compared to gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the cars coming from both sides didn't bother you. What do you think about not wanting to wait for the light?

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, the lane we were driving in seemed like a bicycle lane. It wasn't a regular motor vehicle lane. But as long as it's safe and there are no cars, I think it's fine to drive there.

**Speaker 1:**
We also passed a main road with traffic lights. Someone just turned there. How did you feel about that turn? Did you notice the speed or the behavior in that open stretch?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I could feel the deceleration. Did you feel it too?

**Speaker 1:**
I didn't notice it much from the video; it seemed a bit far. What was the situation like for you?

**Speaker 2:**
I remember the driver eased off the accelerator. The car was coasting in idle mode. There was a turn, but it wasn't necessary to brake hard.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about that long turn? How did it compare to the road near the kindergarten we passed earlier?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. I mainly get annoyed by temporary stops on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean you get annoyed as both a driver and a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it’s frustrating when the car stops on a regular driving lane.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the way the driver handled the stop? What would make it comfortable for you?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the driver handled it well. There were no cars coming from the opposite direction, just some pedestrians. The driver did a good job; it felt safe.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the stretch of road after the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It was comfortable. The driver managed it well.
**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about that stretch of road, the one between the two right turns? It was quite narrow, and there were oncoming cars. What was your impression?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't really notice if there were specific markings for parking on that stretch. From my memory, it seemed like a shared space for both pedestrians and vehicles, without designated temporary parking spots. However, there were parked cars on both sides. In a situation with heavy traffic and many pedestrians, it can be quite dangerous and challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
It really tests the driver's experience and judgment. What specific factors on this road made you feel it was dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**
The parked cars on the roadside, especially those with engines still running, pose a risk. There's always the possibility of someone opening a car door without noticing oncoming traffic. Additionally, in poor visibility conditions like rain, with people wearing raincoats or using umbrellas, it can be hazardous. The lack of clear separation between lanes also adds to the risk.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the behavior of occupying lanes can make you feel uneasy?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it makes me want to keep my distance. There's a subconscious feeling of wanting to stay away to avoid potential accidents. 

**Speaker 1:**
In such situations, how do you think a driver should respond? Considering the parked cars with engines running, many electric scooters with umbrellas, and the lack of clear lane separation, what would be an acceptable way for a driver to handle this?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the driver might not have many options. Perhaps a reminder to the passengers about the potential risks on this stretch of road would help. It would make me feel a bit more at ease if the driver acknowledged the higher risk compared to other roads.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would appreciate a heads-up from the driver about the situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. For instance, if the driver mentioned that we are approaching a tricky area, it would make me feel more secure. 

**Speaker 1:**
What about the right turn we just took? How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
There was a car with its engine running, which was quite annoying. It made me feel uneasy. 

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think the driver should just proceed cautiously and navigate around obstacles as needed?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there's no other way. The driver should either slow down or pass through quickly and carefully.

**Speaker 1:**
How slow do you think the driver should go in such situations?
**Speaker 1:** So, there's no other way, we just have to deal with it.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, in such situations, it's best to either slow down significantly or speed up to pass through quickly.

**Speaker 1:** How slow do you think we should go to avoid stalling the car?

**Speaker 2:** I think it depends on the road conditions. For example, on a narrow road like the one we just passed before the right turn, where there are mixed vehicles, it might be better to go slowly because there could be pedestrians or electric bikes. But on this stretch of road, where there are no electric bikes or pedestrians, it’s better to pass through quickly if it's clear.

**Speaker 1:** So, if there are no people around, it's better to go faster. But if there are many people, it's safer to go slower. Here, there are many parking spaces, and we are approaching another intersection without traffic lights. How did you feel when there were suddenly twice as many cars?

**Speaker 2:** When we turn left later, there might be some aggressive driving because there are no traffic lights. The cars might rush.

**Speaker 1:** How do you evaluate such behavior?

**Speaker 2:** I don't think there's much to evaluate. It's just that the two drivers have different perspectives and are both in a hurry. In this weather, neither wants to yield. Also, I don't know the situation of the queue behind our car. If I were the driver of the white car in front, and there was a long line of cars behind me, I might not yield either. But if there were only one or two cars, I might let them go.

**Speaker 1:** From a passenger's perspective, how do you feel in such situations without traffic lights and with many cars?

**Speaker 2:** Just wait patiently. Safety is the priority.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver's behavior of cutting in is acceptable, or was it intentional?

**Speaker 2:** The driver needed to turn left, and without traffic lights, that's the only way to go. If others don't let you through, you have no choice.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver should be more aggressive or more patient?

**Speaker 2:** The driver's behavior at the intersection was acceptable.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think the entire left-turn maneuver was acceptable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, considering the number of cars behind, he couldn't afford to wait indefinitely.

**Speaker 1:** Earlier, there was a car on the right. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** It was quite far away, especially on city roads like this. It wouldn't cause a serious accident.
**Speaker 1:** So, you might not be as concerned about the car on your right side.

**Speaker 2:** Right, it's farther away, especially on city roads. Even if an accident happens, there's still some space on my right.

**Speaker 1:** So, the closer something is to you, the more attention you pay to it. On rainy days, when many cars stop by the roadside, do you think the speed is okay? Today, it's raining, and I had to make a right turn. How did that feel to you?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel any discomfort or safety concerns on this stretch of road.

**Speaker 1:** And here, there's a very smooth transition into the service area. How did that feel?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was very smooth, unlike the first U-turn.

**Speaker 1:** It's the same person driving, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Haha, alright. Where did you feel the smoothness?

**Speaker 2:** It was very seamless. The turn was made in one go, and the speed and direction were well-controlled, maintaining a good distance from the surroundings.

**Speaker 1:** It felt comfortable, like it was at a constant speed. The distance between cars was also well-maintained within a safe range.

**Speaker 1:** What about entering the parking lot?

**Speaker 2:** That part was a bit tight. Your car is quite wide.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, and the road is quite narrow. The car's wheelbase is normal, though.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Now, let's watch the video. I have a few more questions. Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver during the trip?

**Speaker 2:** No, there were no dangerous maneuvers. 

**Speaker 1:** How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:** Not using the phone or making calls while driving.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think these actions are unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Driving is a serious responsibility for both the driver's and others' lives. Nothing is urgent enough to risk safety. So, making calls or texting while driving is unacceptable.

**Speaker 1:** If the driver engages in such behavior, it makes you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's irresponsible and shows a disregard for life.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. Can you recall any external situations while riding in a car that made you feel particularly unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Electric bikes running red lights, elderly or young people rushing to catch a bus, large vehicles quickly merging at intersections, and buses pulling out of stops, especially in congested areas.

**Speaker 1:** Buses pulling out also make you feel uneasy?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because of their large size.
**Speaker 1:**  
When a bus leaves the station, it can feel quite intimidating, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, for two main reasons. First, buses are quite large. Second, many bus drivers can be quite aggressive. They don't have a front hood like cars do, so they sit right at the front. When I'm driving, I can see them very closely, but it's different for cars. We have a hood, and we have to judge the distance between our headlights and the bus.

**Speaker 1:**  
It makes you feel much smaller in comparison. So, can you recall any specific situations inside the car that made you particularly scared?

**Speaker 2:**  
Inside the car? Why would I be scared inside the car? 

**Speaker 1:**  
For example, as a passenger, if you see another car cutting in close, or like some passengers we've interviewed, they might be scared if a large vehicle is very close to them. From the perspective of being inside the car, what makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**  
It's more about the uncontrollable situations. Large vehicles are somewhat okay because they are made of metal. But if it's a pedestrian, an electric bike, or a motorcycle very close to me, I feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**  
But aren't you also inside a metal vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, but I worry about my car hitting them and causing an accident. I'm not worried about my safety, but it would be a hassle.

**Speaker 1:**  
What actions by the driver make you feel particularly unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**  
Sudden braking, rapid acceleration, and sudden turns. Anything abrupt makes me feel scared.

**Speaker 1:**  
And?

**Speaker 2:**  
Also, if the driver is very agitated, complaining, and expressing negative emotions, it makes me feel unsafe. It feels like they are spreading their stress to me, which is very annoying.

**Speaker 1:**  
You mentioned that you also drive. What bad habits do you have while driving that might be dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**  
For example, if I receive an important phone call while on the main road, or if there's an urgent situation, I might change lanes quickly or even change lanes multiple times to reach a service area. This could be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**  
But these situations are rare, right? It's like when you're handling something urgent, you might forget about safe driving practices.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, but I still try to prioritize safety. However, others might find my actions annoying, especially if I change lanes multiple times.
**Speaker 1:**
Under the premise of safety, I might still do it. But others might find it annoying, thinking I'm a nuisance, especially if I switch lanes continuously.

**Speaker 2:**
I wouldn't answer the phone while driving. I would hang up and find a safe place to handle the situation. However, during this process, I might do some things that others find annoying.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't press the horn much during the entire trip, and the one time you did, it seemed accidental. Do you think drivers should pay attention to the comfort of their passengers while driving? 

**Speaker 2:**
Of course. 

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think today's driver paid attention to your comfort as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes. For instance, when making a U-turn, the driver was considerate, especially towards the passengers in the back seat. If the U-turn is too sharp, it can make backseat passengers feel dizzy, especially those who are sensitive. Also, when making a left turn at an intersection, the driver could have accelerated but chose not to, which showed consideration.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt the driver could have accelerated but didn't, which showed they were paying attention to your comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the acceleration was gradual. However, there were a couple of times when the sudden acceleration made me feel they weren't paying attention.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was inconsistent?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver might have thought that during turns, passengers could be thrown around, so they were more considerate. But during straight-line acceleration, they might have thought it wouldn't be as uncomfortable for the passengers.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Talking on the phone or texting makes me uncomfortable. It shows they're distracted. For example, when waiting at a red light, if the driver suddenly notices the light has turned green and accelerates quickly, it can be jarring for the passengers. Or if they're distracted by a phone call and have to brake suddenly because the car in front stops abruptly, it can be very uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
It's easy to get distracted.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, many people have an idealized confidence in their driving skills and their ability to judge the surrounding environment. They think they have everything under control.

**Speaker 1:**
Overconfidence.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver might anticipate the need to brake or accelerate, but the passengers don't know this, so while the driver might not feel uncomfortable, the passengers do.
**Speaker 1:**
Drivers often have a sense of anticipation about when to brake or accelerate, but passengers don't know this, so while the driver might not feel uncomfortable, the passengers often do. How do you think we can make passengers feel this anticipation or avoid this discomfort?

**Speaker 2:**
One way is if passengers are really engrossed in their phones or distracted, the driver should maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to give everyone enough reaction time. It might only take a second, but I think it makes a big difference.

**Speaker 1:**
That would definitely improve the experience. You mentioned you drive regularly. What are some of your driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Everyone who rides with me says they don't feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
What about specific situations? For example, if someone has had a drink and sits in the back, can they sleep without feeling nauseous?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they can sleep for three hours without feeling sick.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a good driver? What defines a professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
First, it's about following traffic laws. For professional drivers like ride-share or taxi drivers, it's about smooth driving and keeping the car clean. Also, maintaining a stable emotional state is important.

**Speaker 1:**
From a passenger's perspective, what makes a driver seem professional and skilled?

**Speaker 2:**
Smooth driving and having a thorough understanding of the vehicle, including its condition and the distance between cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's say you're in a self-driving car. What would make you feel that it's professional?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't have high expectations for self-driving cars. The road conditions are often too complex for even humans to make accurate predictions. A self-driving car might only ensure it doesn't actively cause harm.

**Speaker 1:**
So you think the complexity of road conditions makes it hard for machines to make accurate judgments?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for example, if there's a parked car on a two-way street and another car needs to pass, it would have to go into the opposite lane, which is against the rules. A self-driving car wouldn't do that, but if it doesn't, the road could get blocked.

**Speaker 1:**
So the rules are too rigid and not flexible enough?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. If you make the system flexible, it might break traffic rules on main roads. It's a difficult balance to achieve.
**Speaker 1:**
Flexible.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but if you set it to be flexible, it might break traffic rules on the main road. It's hard to judge.

**Speaker 1:**
It's a tricky balance, right.

**Speaker 2:**
Like people, sometimes when driving the wrong way, you have to check for cameras, or when running a red light, you have to look around, right? But with this, you can't do that.

**Speaker 1:**
In situations where it's safe to be a bit flexible, do you think it makes the ride more comfortable and smooth, with less danger? What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
New drivers are either too aggressive or too timid, always looking around nervously. Or they are fearless because they don't know any better. Experienced drivers have a lot of experience. They know how to handle various road conditions, including rain and snow, and other natural influences.

**Speaker 1:**
They have their own ways of handling things, right.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and they also understand and maintain their cars better.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by understanding and maintaining their cars?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, in very hot weather, I might need to cool down my radiator. On rainy days, I might need to clean out any carbon buildup.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're saying the difference is partly in how they maintain their vehicles. Experienced drivers don't care much about comfort, while new drivers are too focused on just driving the car.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, experienced drivers don't worry about comfort as much, and new drivers are just trying to manage the basics.

**Speaker 1:**
What aspects do you think autonomous cars will never be able to handle like a human?

**Speaker 2:**
Mobility and reacting to sudden events. For example, if I need to park in a no-parking zone, I can judge whether I can park based on whether there are cameras. 

**Speaker 1:**
So parking is one example.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but also while driving, if there's an obstacle, I need to decide if I can proceed without getting fined or caught on camera, while still moving forward safely.

**Speaker 1:**
So, within the conditions you believe are permissible, you try to maximize your road rights, vehicle rights, and speed. Are there other aspects where you think autonomous driving can't match human drivers, especially experienced ones?

**Speaker 2:**
Autonomous driving is essentially a pre-programmed machine. It can't have a real-time human judgment during driving.
**Speaker 1:** So, it's essentially a machine that you've programmed, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's a machine that I've set up. I can't have someone controlling it in real-time while driving, making decisions about whether to take a turn or overtake a car. It's more suited for general driving conditions. In more complex situations, like narrow alleys, it can't match human judgment, especially in terms of recognizing distances as accurately as the human eye.

**Speaker 1:** I see. How do you feel about its acceptance level?

**Speaker 2:** For example, if I have a bottle of water and I need to pass it through a narrow space, I would set it to leave 5 centimeters on each side. But in a narrow alley, where there's only a finger-width gap, you just have to go through it. In such cases, it's too rigid compared to an experienced driver. It needs to be more aggressive while still ensuring safety.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it can't compare to an experienced driver. It needs to be more aggressive while still ensuring safety.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. I think it's more suitable for cautious passengers who prioritize absolute safety and comfort. During our drive, there were moments when I felt tense, even though it was within a safe range. Some passengers might not tolerate that and would feel scared.

**Speaker 1:** Everyone has their own individual differences. Do you think the car was being driven by a person or was it on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes it felt like a person was driving, and other times it felt like it was on autopilot. For instance, during the U-turn, it felt like a driver was in control, but at other times, it didn't match a human's driving style.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt that at certain moments, it was a person driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, like during the first U-turn.

**Speaker 1:** Who do you think was driving during the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** The U-turn was likely handled by the machine.

**Speaker 1:** And when did it feel like a driver was in control?

**Speaker 2:** During the rapid acceleration, like when overtaking.

**Speaker 1:** Rapid acceleration?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, during the overtaking maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:** How do you judge whether it's autopilot or a driver?

**Speaker 2:** I judge based on comfort and driving style. If it feels smooth and safe, it's likely autopilot. If it's more aggressive, it's probably a driver. For instance, the first and last U-turns felt different, which made me think it wasn't the same driver.

**Speaker 1:** So, your criteria are that autopilot feels safer and smoother, while a driver is more aggressive?
**Speaker 1:**
So, what are your criteria for judging? Do you think autonomous driving is safer and smoother, while human drivers are more aggressive? Or is this just your personal judgment?

**Speaker 2:**
It's just that under the same conditions, the driving experience feels different. For example, when making a U-turn, both U-turns were made under normal conditions with green lights. However, the first U-turn was done very slowly and cautiously, taking a long distance to complete.

**Speaker 1:**
Who do you think was driving during that U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It was the machine driving. The last U-turn was very smooth, which seemed to match the demeanor of an experienced driver, even though I can't say for sure it was a seasoned driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Could it be related to the traffic flow? Because there were quite a few cars during the U-turn, but not as many when merging into the side road. Were the conditions similar?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the U-turn is related to traffic flow, then when there are many fast-moving cars, you should start the U-turn from a greater distance. It's not right to make the U-turn closer to oncoming traffic, reducing your maneuvering space.

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, okay. So, from what you said, you think part of the drive was autonomous and part was driven by a human. How does this experience compare to your usual car rides? You take quite a few rides every week, often for more than half an hour. What's different?

**Speaker 1:**
Whether it was the autonomous driving part or the human-driven part, was there any difference in the experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Not much difference. Maybe in congested areas or when turning, it felt smoother. Especially when sitting in the back seat, because when you take a taxi alone, you rarely sit directly behind the driver. You usually sit in the rear right seat where you can see the driver.

**Speaker 1:**
From that angle, right? What details made you feel that the car wasn't driven by a human? Besides the turns, were there other indicators?

**Speaker 2:**
The distance to the car in front was too far.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean it felt too cautious, unlike a human driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the distance to the car in front was too far, and the speed was too slow. When there were many cars behind and the speed increased, the distance to the car in front didn't seem as far as before.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it.
**Speaker 1:**
In situations where there are many cars behind you and you're driving fast, the distance to the car in front of you doesn't seem as far as it used to. Do you understand?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I understand.

**Speaker 1:**
I have a question. If you were a pedestrian at an intersection without traffic lights, how would you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles and drivers? How would you decide whether to cross the street? This might be a bit of a shift in perspective, but you can think about it from the viewpoint of a pedestrian or a driver in a busy area.

**Speaker 2:**
How do I judge if I can cross? Is that right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 2:**
First, I look to see if the car is trying to push forward.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean if the car is moving forward?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the car is pushing forward, like the one we saw earlier, I would definitely cross behind it. If it's pushing forward, it won't get through immediately. In normal driving conditions, I would walk behind it. This indicates that either the car is moving very slowly or is almost stationary. I can ensure my own safety by crossing behind it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean that even if the car is moving slowly, you feel you can cross faster, right? Are there any other criteria you use to judge the driver's intentions?

**Speaker 2:**
How do I judge? When crossing the street, if I can cross quickly, I will raise my hand to signal the driver to let me go first.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would directly interact with the driver. Would you ever choose to ignore the car and just rush across, or would you keep approaching the car?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the situation. If there are no cars and one car is approaching quickly from a distance, I would cross quickly and signal my intention to cross. If the car is close and moving fast, I would let it pass because it would be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you consider a dangerous distance?

**Speaker 2:**
A dangerous distance? If the car is moving at 30-40 km/h and is about 10 meters away, I would let it pass. If it's moving faster, I definitely wouldn't cross.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Thank you for your time today. It's getting late, and I appreciate your patience. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Can you tell me which parts were driven by the car and which by the person? The turns are definitely different, and for U-turns, we consider safety, so it's always the driver handling it.

**Speaker 2:**
That part doesn't concern me.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, thank you.
**Speaker 1:**
Actually, when it comes to making a U-turn, we always consider safety first, so it's always the driver who handles it, haha.

**Speaker 2:**
That has nothing to do with me, it's all on him.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, and here we have a form.

**Speaker 2:**
Why are you laughing so much, haha?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, this form is part of our official experiment process. We follow a procedure, and we might need to transfer some compensation to you in the form of a service fee. If you don't remember, it's okay. You can add me on WeChat and take a picture of it later, haha.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you know what "面" means?

**Speaker 1:**
Meaning? Well, it's kind of like having a lot on your plate. Driving can be tough. Today was really challenging. Isn't your company managing things? I put an umbrella on your small cart, but I didn't check the weather forecast. I thought only in the UK would there be issues. I thought I chose never to know. The negativity is everywhere. Did you bring food with you? I'll tidy up a bit.
