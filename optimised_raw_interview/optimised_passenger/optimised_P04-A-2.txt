**Speaker 1:**
Alright, we have started. Okay.

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, you can take a look. Hmm, let me check your questions here. Thank you, can you see them clearly?

**Speaker 2:**
Unless I need to, right? Is that correct? Okay, let's start with some simple questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you usually take long trips or short trips more often? How long do your trips usually last? About half an hour. How do you feel about your experience with our vehicle this time?

**Speaker 1:**
What specifically do you mean?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean in terms of safety and comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
In terms of safety, overall, I feel there are no issues. As for comfort, regarding the vehicle experience, I feel the seat comfort could be better.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you mean the seat is too firm or something else?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it's a bit too hard. It might also be because we adjusted it, so it doesn't feel particularly comfortable. Everything else is fine.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you feel about the driver's skills today?

**Speaker 1:**
I think the female driver did quite well.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think female drivers generally have worse driving skills compared to male drivers?

**Speaker 1:**
Not really, I think there are some biases on the internet.

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, I see. If you had to choose, what type of car do you prefer for traveling? For example, you mentioned electric cars earlier, right? Can you explain why?

**Speaker 1:**
For traveling, it depends on whether it's a long or short trip, and where I'm going. For instance, if I'm going on a road trip, whether it's in the city or in more remote areas, it might affect my choice of vehicle. Personally, I often use electric cars in the city because there are plenty of charging stations, which makes them more convenient. However, for long road trips, especially to remote areas like Tibet, electric cars might not be practical due to the lack of charging facilities.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, charging can be inconvenient in remote areas. Do you drive yourself often? How do you rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 1:**
My driving skills are...

**Speaker 2:**
How many years have you been driving?
**Speaker 1:** Do you drive often? How do you feel about your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:** My driving skills are not very good. How many years have you been driving?

**Speaker 1:** I started in 2021, but I've always been afraid to drive. When I drive, I have this psychological fear because the city traffic is too complicated. I don't know how to handle it. I once drove in Beijing, and I never dared to drive again. While driving, I suddenly blanked out at a traffic light and mistook the gas pedal for the brake. Since then, I haven't dared to drive.

**Speaker 2:** So, do you consider yourself a novice driver now?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I do. I think many novice drivers share the same problem. They have a fear of driving. This fear could be related to safety, pedestrians, or passengers.

**Speaker 2:** What kind of situations cause this fear?

**Speaker 1:** It's mainly about handling unexpected situations. For example, during rush hours, the traffic in Beijing can be really bad and chaotic. I remember a specific place near Wudaoying where the traffic was particularly messy. The navigation didn't match the actual road conditions, and cars were cutting in and out. In such situations, I wouldn't dare to drive because I wouldn't know what to expect.

**Speaker 2:** Do you think navigation systems affect your driving?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I think navigation issues affect not only novice drivers but also experienced ones. Sometimes, when we take a taxi, the navigation can be problematic. Near our school, the navigation often reacts slowly or gives incorrect directions, causing the driver to take wrong turns. This can affect the driver's mood and make the situation worse.

**Speaker 2:** So, the road conditions near your school are quite complicated, right?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it's very chaotic. Now, let's watch the video you recorded earlier. If you recall any uncomfortable moments, feel free to mention them, okay?

**Speaker 2:** Sure. How did you feel about the turn at the beginning of the video?

**Speaker 1:** It felt normal.
**Speaker 1:** If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you can let me know, okay?

**Speaker 2:** Sure. How did you feel about that turn we just took?

**Speaker 1:** It felt normal.

**Speaker 2:** How about the other turns? Any specific feelings about the road conditions?

**Speaker 1:** Overall, nothing major, but there were some sudden behaviors from other drivers.

**Speaker 2:** How did you feel when we crossed the pedestrian crossing and saw the pedestrians?

**Speaker 1:** The pedestrians were quite observant of the traffic rules and stopped accordingly.

**Speaker 2:** Did you feel anything when we accelerated here?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I did. I remember there was a pothole here.

**Speaker 2:** How did that feel?

**Speaker 1:** It was quite bumpy.

**Speaker 2:** How about the road conditions and the driver's skills? Did you feel stable?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, but there was a moment when a car suddenly came towards us from the side.

**Speaker 2:** How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 1:** It seemed like a normal occurrence.

**Speaker 2:** What about when we made a U-turn?

**Speaker 1:** I felt a bit worried because the U-turn light was green, but there were still cars coming from the other direction. I was concerned there might be an accident.

**Speaker 2:** We waited there for quite a while.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, we waited until all the oncoming cars had passed.

**Speaker 2:** Even if the light turns red, you can still make a U-turn here. What was the driver doing? How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 1:** Ideally, the car should have been behind us.

**Speaker 2:** Did you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** How do you feel when there are many buses around?

**Speaker 1:** Not much, really.

**Speaker 2:** The road conditions here are a bit complex.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, there are often delivery scooters.

**Speaker 2:** How do you feel when you encounter delivery scooters?

**Speaker 1:** They usually have the right of way, but in Beijing, I rarely see cars yielding to them. In my hometown, traffic control is strict, and cars usually yield.

**Speaker 2:** How do you feel about the lack of yielding in Beijing? Do you get anxious?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, whether I'm in a car or walking, I feel anxious, especially at traffic lights. Even when the pedestrian light is green, cars can still turn, which makes me nervous.

**Speaker 2:** Have you ever experienced a car in front of you suddenly braking?
**Speaker 1:** I feel anxious in situations where pedestrians are crossing at a green light, and cars are also allowed to turn.

**Speaker 2:** Have you ever experienced a situation where the car in front of you suddenly braked?

**Speaker 1:** No, not during this drive.

**Speaker 2:** How did you feel about that particular place?

**Speaker 1:** I remember it was near a school, and since it was the third time, there were quite a few parents waiting at the entrance. We hadn't yet reached the time when the kids were being dismissed, but we were close.

**Speaker 2:** At that place, you pressed the handle. Why did you do that?

**Speaker 1:** It was probably because...

**Speaker 2:** When there are bicycles ahead, how do you feel?

**Speaker 1:** When there are bicycles and large vehicles...

**Speaker 2:** When large vehicles are driving in the opposite direction, does it make you feel uneasy?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, because there are many cars parked on the side of the road, making the space for large vehicles narrower.

**Speaker 2:** Do you worry about scraping other cars? If the driver waits at the light for a long time, does it affect you psychologically? Do you feel uncomfortable in heavy traffic?

**Speaker 1:** Haha, at that time, I was a bit anxious because I needed to use the restroom.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, so it was an urgent situation.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, but there was nothing particularly special about it.

**Speaker 2:** As you approach a scenic spot and the road is clear, how do you feel if bicycles suddenly appear?

**Speaker 1:** It makes me nervous because you can't predict their sudden movements. You can only control your own actions, not others'.

**Speaker 2:** What if a pedestrian suddenly appears in front of you, crossing the road without a crosswalk?

**Speaker 1:** That would be alarming.

**Speaker 2:** Do you feel that such uncontrollable situations make you fearful?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, especially if I'm distracted by my phone.

**Speaker 2:** What if you're not the one driving?

**Speaker 1:** If I'm not driving, it depends on how much I trust the driver.

**Speaker 2:** On a scale of 1 to 100, how much do you trust today's driver?

**Speaker 1:** 100 points.

**Speaker 2:** How do you feel when the drive is smooth?

**Speaker 1:** I don't feel anything special. It's just normal.

**Speaker 2:** How do you feel about cars driving in the opposite direction?

**Speaker 1:** It's quite concerning.

**Speaker 2:** In situations where the cars are not very close, how do you feel? Did the driver do anything that made you uncomfortable today?

**Speaker 1:** No, I hope the driver is considerate and cautious.

**Speaker 2:** Do you feel unsafe, or is it more about trusting the driver?

**Speaker 1:** It's more about trusting the driver.

**Speaker 2:** So you deducted 20 points for that, haha.

**Speaker 2:** Was the driver driving fast?

**Speaker 1:** No, just normal driving.
**Speaker 1:**
It's about trust in the driver.

**Speaker 2:**
So you deducted 20 points from him, haha.

**Speaker 2:**
Was he driving fast?

**Speaker 1:**
No, just normal driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, considering it was rush hour, did you feel the traffic was heavy? How did you feel about the area? If not, we can skip this part. Let's move on to other related questions. Besides the fact that you mentioned the driver wearing a seatbelt, which made you feel safer, did he exhibit any other behaviors today that made you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**
Unsafe? Hmm, not particularly unsafe, but there were moments, like when turning, where he could have avoided some potholes but didn't. The road conditions allowed for avoidance, but he didn't notice and drove right over them. Though, this isn't a big deal.

**Speaker 2:**
So, he specifically didn't avoid them?

**Speaker 1:**
No, I think he just didn't notice them.

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, not noticing them can make the ride bumpy and uncomfortable. In your daily life, are there any behaviors from drivers that make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
Specifically?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, in terms of your comfort. Your subjective experience.

**Speaker 1:**
When taking a taxi or any car ride, discomfort usually comes from erratic driving—speeding up and slowing down frequently. The car's interior environment, like smells and temperature, can also cause discomfort and sometimes motion sickness. Sometimes, the smell inside a taxi is overwhelming, or it's extremely hot, which makes it easy to get motion sickness.

**Speaker 2:**
Are you referring to specific smells like perfume or bad odors?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, like the smell of baby formula. But these smells can vary; some people find strong scents, even pleasant ones, overwhelming.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you're sensitive to smells. Do you get motion sickness naturally, or only when you encounter these strong smells?

**Speaker 1:**
Normally, I don't get motion sickness, but if there's a strong smell or if it's very stuffy inside, it can trigger it.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you define comfort during a ride?

**Speaker 1:**
Comfort during a ride, for me, starts the moment I sit down. The seat and the car's interior space should feel comfortable. As a passenger, I also value the driver's ability to maintain a smooth ride, control the speed, and handle any potential hazards effectively.
**Speaker 1:**
So, what I just felt was the smoothness during the driving process, your control over the speed, and how you handle dangerous situations. These factors can affect comfort. Also, the car's interior environment, like the smell and temperature, can influence comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
When you mentioned space, were you referring to the size?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, for example, some cars have a very cramped back seat. When we usually take a taxi, we mostly sit in the back seat and rarely in the front passenger seat. The distance in the back seat varies; some cars, like BYD, have a spacious back seat. Some cars are tighter, making it uncomfortable to sit. Today, when I sat in the front passenger seat, the seat cushion felt hard, and the angle of the seat and backrest adjustment made it uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
What kind of angle do you think would be more comfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
It seems to vary.

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the person. Some people...

**Speaker 1:**
...like to sit fully into the seat. Some prefer a more ergonomic fit, naturally leaning back.

**Speaker 2:**
Which one do you prefer?

**Speaker 1:**
I prefer to lean back naturally, so I don't feel awkward sitting there, hahaha.

**Speaker 2:**
In your opinion, do drivers usually pay attention to your comfort?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, sometimes when I take a taxi, the driver will adjust the front seat forward a lot because they know passengers usually sit in the back. So, they leave more space.

**Speaker 2:**
What about the temperature and other settings?

**Speaker 1:**
Temperature settings can be an issue. I've had bad experiences. For instance, during a severe sandstorm in Beijing, the driver kept the window open, which I didn't understand given the heavy sand.

**Speaker 2:**
Did you tell him?

**Speaker 1:**
I did, but he still left a small window open.

**Speaker 2:**
He might have preferred ventilation. Have you encountered any unsafe behaviors?

**Speaker 1:**
Generally, it's been safe. With ride-hailing services, there have been many incidents, but there is more regulation and supervision now.
**Speaker 1:** Nowadays, things are generally quite calm, but when it comes to taking a taxi, there have been many incidents with ride-hailing services recently, leading to increased regulatory oversight.

**Speaker 2:** Are you referring to personal safety issues? Have you experienced any specific behaviors during your rides that made you feel there might be a traffic hazard?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, for example, when it comes to yielding to pedestrians. There are instances where drivers don't yield at all, which can create unsafe situations.

**Speaker 2:** Are you concerned about the danger the driver poses to pedestrians, or is it something else?

**Speaker 1:** It's actually both. If an accident were to happen, it would be unsafe for both the pedestrians and the passengers in the car. Additionally, there are those situations on highways, especially during holidays, where accidents are more common. Just a few days ago, I saw a serious accident where two cars flipped over on an overpass. It was very alarming, especially when people are in a hurry and start cutting in line.

**Speaker 2:** So, when people are in a rush, they tend to drive recklessly?

**Speaker 2:** How do you define safety in this context?

**Speaker 1:** First and foremost, it's about personal safety. When you're taking a ride, the main thing is to avoid traffic accidents. You want to arrive at your destination safely and within the expected time frame, without any incidents.

**Speaker 2:** When you take a taxi, do you have specific time requirements? For instance, if the driver doesn't get you to your destination within the time you need, how do you feel about that?

**Speaker 1:** I definitely get anxious, especially depending on the situation. For example, if I'm taking a taxi to work in the morning, I want the driver to get me there as quickly as possible. However, during rush hour, traffic jams are unavoidable.

**Speaker 2:** What do you think makes a driver professional enough?

**Speaker 1:** Let me think. A good experience would include the driver arriving on time to pick you up. Before you even get in the car, they should be punctual. Once you're in the car, they might remind you of the route or any potential delays. The car should be clean and tidy, and the ride should be smooth. Most importantly, they should get you to your destination on time. If they can do all that, then they are quite competent.

**Speaker 2:** So, you focus more on...
**Speaker 1:** The environment was quite stable, and the driver managed to get me to my destination on time. Overall, it was a satisfactory experience.

**Speaker 2:** So, you are more concerned about the reliability and your subjective comfort inside the car, right? As a new driver, how do you think you differ from experienced drivers?

**Speaker 1:** I just don't dare to drive.

**Speaker 2:** Right, and?

**Speaker 1:** Experienced drivers can handle unexpected situations more rationally and calmly, avoiding potential safety issues. But as a new driver, if I encounter such situations, I might panic. My mind goes blank, and I don't know how to solve the problem.

**Speaker 2:** Are there any other differences besides handling accidents?

**Speaker 1:** Another difference might be in speed control. Recently, I drove in the suburbs of Beijing with three roommates in the car. They all got car sick because my speed control was inconsistent. Their feedback was that sometimes I drove too fast and other times too slow, which made them feel anxious.

**Speaker 2:** I see. If you were a passenger and the driver had inconsistent speed, would you feel anxious too?

**Speaker 1:** I generally avoid driving.

**Speaker 2:** Haha, so today we are testing an autonomous driving system. What do you think are the limitations of autonomous cars compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 1:** I think autonomous driving is quite advanced now. However, it might not handle unexpected situations well. I have experienced autonomous driving mostly on highways, where it works fine. But on regular roads, which are more complex, it might struggle to make accurate judgments.

**Speaker 2:** You mean in complex traffic conditions?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, like sudden lane changes, cutting in, or unexpected pedestrians. In such cases, autonomous systems might not respond as effectively.

**Speaker 2:** But do you think they might still handle it to some extent?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, they might, but currently, I mostly experience autonomous driving on highways, not in city traffic.

**Speaker 2:** Do you think the car we just rode in was driven by a human or was it autonomous?

**Speaker 1:** Was it autonomous? You tell me! Haha, I felt it was driven by a human because the driver was shifting gears while reversing and turning. So, I think it was a human driver.
**Speaker 1:** Why do you think that?

**Speaker 2:** Because I felt that the driver was a human. She was shifting gears while reversing and turning.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly. I didn't think it was autonomous driving.

**Speaker 2:** She was shifting gears and doing other things as well.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, including steering, speed, and distance control. Normally, with autonomous driving, the system maintains a stable distance and speed. It keeps the speed you set, but during the experience, there were some variations. So, I think it was a human driving.

**Speaker 2:** Actually, the vehicle you were in was autonomous. The driver was just pretending to drive. Did you notice any differences compared to a regular driving experience?

**Speaker 1:** If it was autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, think back to the details. Was there any moment that made you feel it wasn't a human driving?

**Speaker 1:** Honestly, I didn't notice anything.

**Speaker 2:** So, you completely believed it was a human driver?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I thought it was a human. There was a situation with pedestrians at an intersection without traffic lights. How do you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles or cars in such scenarios? For example, whether they want to go straight or turn?

**Speaker 2:** If it's left or right, you look at the turn signals. Mainly, you judge by the car's movement. If there are no traffic lights and the car wants to go, it will accelerate. By observing whether the car is moving, you can judge if it will let you go first or not.

**Speaker 1:** Would you just rush through regardless of the car's movement?

**Speaker 2:** No, I would approach cautiously, observe its intentions, and then decide step by step.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, that's the best approach. Without traffic lights, both parties are unsure of each other's intentions. You have to test and see how to proceed. Sometimes, drivers use hand signals to communicate, indicating who should go first or if they should stop.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, there's a lot of that. Would you wait for all the cars to pass before you go?

**Speaker 1:** Not necessarily. It depends on the driver's personality.

**Speaker 2:** So, you would observe how they react?

**Speaker 1:** Yes. How do you define the intelligence of a vehicle?

**Speaker 2:** Vehicle intelligence? It mainly involves...
**Speaker 1:** How do you define the intelligence of a vehicle?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the intelligence of a vehicle. Mainly, the most common feature is autonomous driving. For new drivers like me, features like automatic parking are very useful. Some cars can automatically park by detecting obstacles. If there's an obstacle, the car can identify it and park accordingly. Once the obstacle is removed, the car can automatically adjust and park itself. This is quite intelligent.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's about the car's ability to make judgments. But do you think its judgment is primarily to serve humans?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think many smart cars today are doing quite well in this regard.

**Speaker 1:** Have you driven such smart cars before?

**Speaker 2:** I've tested one on the highway. My family owns a Tesla, which has an autonomous driving feature.

**Speaker 1:** That's great. So, our interview can end here. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker 2:** Or was it really autonomous driving just now?

**Speaker 1:** No, it wasn't. But that's our perspective on this topic.
