**Speaker 1:**
Alright. Before we start our interview, I need to ask you a few questions about your daily driving and riding habits. Do you often travel by car? And is it usually for long or short distances?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short distances, usually within half an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle for this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, it was quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
For a female driver, her skills are quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think female drivers generally have less driving skill compared to male drivers? If so, in what specific ways?

**Speaker 2:**
Mainly in handling unexpected situations. Female drivers tend to be less flexible and not as adept at managing sudden issues smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car and fuel would you prefer for your travels?

**Speaker 2:**
For short trips, I prefer a regular sedan. For long trips, I would choose an SUV.

**Speaker 1:**
And why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
For short trips, which are usually within the city and under an hour, comfort is key. Sedans generally offer better seating and suspension for city driving. However, for long trips, especially when traveling to unfamiliar places, an SUV is better due to its superior performance and power, which makes the journey less worrisome.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you prefer gasoline cars or electric cars? And why?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer gasoline cars. With electric cars, you constantly need to press the pedal unless you have a high-end model that can switch to a mode similar to gasoline cars. In gasoline cars, you only need to press the brake to stop, whereas in electric cars, if you release the accelerator, the car stops automatically. This is hard to get used to for someone who has driven gasoline cars for a long time. It feels strange that the car stops as soon as you release the accelerator. So, many people prefer driving gasoline cars.
**Speaker 1:**
As someone who has driven gasoline cars for a long time, it can be hard to accept that when you release the accelerator, the car stops moving. Many people prefer driving gasoline cars for this reason. Additionally, in China, the objective situation is that if you drive an electric car, you can only drive it around the city and not venture out too far. Charging stations are another concern. In the north, during winter, electric cars consume power very quickly. For example, a Tesla might be rated for 500 kilometers, but in a Beijing winter, it might only manage 300 kilometers, which is a significant drop. So generally, people avoid using them.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you have been driving for a long time. How do you think you drive? Do you consider yourself an expert?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I drive cautiously. I wouldn't call myself an expert. I drive steadily but not fast.

**Speaker 1:**
So, stability is key for you.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, safety first.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I will play a video of our recent drive. If you have any thoughts or changes in your experience while watching, please let me know. I might pause at certain points to ask about your feelings on specific segments. Let's start.

**Speaker 1:**
You can see the positions of the controls here. I will pause at these points to ask for specific reasons. These annotations can be ignored; they are just company notes. This is the actual Beijing time. Let's skip to the starting part. Do you think the car started quickly?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it didn't start quickly. But it was fine because the roads there are narrow and there are many electric bikes.

**Speaker 1:**
You can see it made several turns here. How do you think it handled the turns?

**Speaker 2:**
It was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Did it meet your expectations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but this area is tricky because there are many electric vehicles around. At this point, you pressed the handle, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I felt the car wasn't handling well. It felt unstable.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the front passenger seat?

**Speaker 2:**
The front passenger seat wasn't comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Many passengers have mentioned that.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the lack of comfort in the front passenger seat, combined with poor suspension, makes the overall experience less pleasant.
**Speaker 1:** So, how did you find the overall driving experience, especially regarding the car's suspension and seat comfort?

**Speaker 2:** Honestly, I felt the suspension and seat comfort were lacking, which made the ride quite bumpy.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driver handled the situation, aside from the car's inherent issues?

**Speaker 2:** On straight roads, I think the driver did okay.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, that's good to hear. Did you notice any specific actions the driver took?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt the bumps quite a bit. You can see there are warnings and uneven road surfaces with potholes. If I were driving, I would have steered the car so that the wheels went around the potholes or manhole covers.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver today paid attention to these details?

**Speaker 2:** I don't think so. Usually, only experienced drivers pay attention to such details. Most drivers focus on avoiding major obstacles and ensuring safety first. Comfort comes second. I believe the driver prioritized safety, which is the right approach.

**Speaker 1:** But do you think if the driver had paid more attention, it could have made the ride more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if the driver had been more aware, it could have been more comfortable. When the driver steers to avoid obstacles, I understand what they are doing. From the front passenger seat, I can see the manhole covers and uneven surfaces, so I know why the driver is steering in a certain way. I think the driver did a good job overall.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's just an additional point for improvement, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Let's continue.

**Speaker 1:** Did you use the handlebar at any point?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did. At that moment, I might have pressed it because there was a manhole cover or a speed bump. Generally, this area is tricky because the road might immediately turn left or right, and there could be a speed bump. It's not easy for the driver to control the car perfectly in such situations. In hindsight, the driver handled it quite well.

**Speaker 1:** When you're in the front passenger seat, what do you mainly focus on?

**Speaker 2:** I primarily focus on safety. Comfort is secondary to me, but safety is the most important.

**Speaker 1:** So, when you observe the road, what do you mainly look out for?

**Speaker 2:** I mainly look for any potential hazards or obstacles that could affect the safety of the ride.
**Speaker 1:**
First of all, under the premise of being quiet, let's talk about comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right. So, when you observe the road outside, what do you mainly look at?

**Speaker 1:**
I look at everything, except...

**Speaker 2:**
Because I need to see the whole view. Even though the driver is on my left side, I instinctively look left and right at intersections. That's just how I am.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it doesn't really matter where you're sitting in the car; you always pay attention to the road.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right. Even when I'm sitting in the back seat, I still look.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you ever look at the driver's eyes to see where they are paying attention?

**Speaker 2:**
Not usually. In general, if I encounter an extreme situation, I would shout out to alert the driver. For example, if there's a car coming from the left or an electric bike from the right, I would shout out instead of looking at the driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the urge to do that during this trip?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there was a moment, especially when we were parking. I felt like I needed to say something, but I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
We can discuss that later.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, you can see the camera shake a bit. Did you feel that in the car just now?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel it. I know the driver was accelerating. I think it was more about the acceleration rather than a bump. The road ahead was clear, so he just accelerated.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think he maintained the distance from the bicycles in front?

**Speaker 2:**
I think he did well. If it were me, I would have done the same.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would have driven the same way.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because you can't drive too slowly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, he did a good job in that aspect.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you press the handle here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. I was just indicating that there was a parked car and a bicycle coming. If it were me, I would have been very cautious and let the bicycle pass first. I wouldn't try to rush through.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he should have slowed down to let the pedestrian pass first.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, or at least be more aware and move slightly to the side.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he should have slowed down to let the pedestrian pass first?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, or at least been more aware and moved slightly to the side.

**Speaker 1:**
But he didn't, right? So, you were specifically observing the driver's actions, correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I could tell because I would know if he was steering or not.

**Speaker 1:**
I have another question. When you're a passenger, do you find the driver's emotional stability very important?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver's emotional stability and physical condition are very important to me.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you spend some time observing the driver's state?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I usually do.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you observe it today as well?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think he did when merging onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
I think he did okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you check the rearview mirror? Did you notice if he checked the rearview mirror when merging?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't check the rearview mirror because I was in the passenger seat and couldn't see it. The rearview mirror is on his left side, so only the driver can see it. I would have to turn my head to look, and even then, it's not easy to see from my position.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't check it, right?

**Speaker 2:**
But I did look before he entered the main road because there were few cars. When he was turning right, there weren't many cars on the left side, so I didn't think there would be any issues.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned it was his first time driving. How was that experience?

**Speaker 2:**
The first time he drove, he needed to reverse a bit. I guided him to move forward and then reverse slightly. Initially, he didn't follow the traffic rules properly, which was unsafe because the road was a fast lane. He should have stayed close to the side and observed the traffic before merging.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anxious or worried when he did that for the first time?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the first time I was quite anxious and even pressed the horn. But the second time, he seemed more aware and controlled. He stopped and then merged, which was better. So, I think he was more prepared for normal driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any other memorable moments during our drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Not particularly, but I was generally observing his driving behavior throughout.
**Speaker 1:**
So, when you first started driving, were there any memorable experiences? Feel free to share any significant moments during our conversation, as they are very valuable.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there were a few. This is my second time driving, so it's still fresh. The first time, I made a mistake by merging into the lane too quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
If you were driving yourself, how would you handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
I would follow the car ahead, check the left side to ensure there are no cars, and then signal and merge carefully. It's important to follow traffic rules.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you believe that following traffic rules is crucial. Even as a passenger, you value this, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because any traffic violation can lead to accidents. It's essential to follow the rules.

**Speaker 1:**
When you drive, do you always follow traffic rules strictly?

**Speaker 2:**
Not always. Sometimes you have to consider practical aspects, like in school.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean there are exceptions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, like when you have to adapt to the situation. It's like how students sometimes get help with their homework.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's a common phenomenon?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, everyone has done it at some point. It's impossible to follow every rule perfectly all the time.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. So, about the U-turn you mentioned earlier...

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he didn't make the U-turn correctly the first time. An experienced driver would have turned the wheel to the right first to create a larger turning radius. But he tried to turn directly and had to adjust multiple times.

**Speaker 1:**
So, he made the turn too wide?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the distance wasn't enough. He should have turned slightly to the right first, ensuring no cars were coming, and then made the turn. The first time, he saw another car turning and tried to follow, but it didn't work out.
**Speaker 1:** Under the condition that there were no cars around, you saw the car in front start to turn right. The young lady saw the other car turning and tried to turn as well, but it was her first time, so she found it particularly difficult. She consciously tried to turn right and make a U-turn. Although she did turn, it wasn't enough, and she almost hit the greenbelt in front. You can see that she was very close to the greenbelt.

**Speaker 1:** I want to ask, was there any car when she made the first turn?

**Speaker 2:** No, there wasn't. If there had been, I would have definitely turned more to the right. Also, if there were normal traffic, all the vehicles would have moved slightly to the right because everyone knows that cars making U-turns will turn a bit to the right. So, there's no need to stay close to the left. You can see where the left wheel of this car is. It's in the middle. This means the driver knew the other cars had made space. They might have crossed the solid line, but in reality, that's how people drive. No one wants to keep adjusting at the intersection because it's less safe. It's safer to make the turn in one go.

**Speaker 1:** So, the second time you saw her making a U-turn, you honked.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the distance wasn't enough.

**Speaker 1:** Let's continue watching and discuss it slowly.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, the car turned right.

**Speaker 2:** Although we were aware of the direction, the car's front was very close to the greenbelt. The video might not show it clearly, but in reality, it was very close.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt a bit worried.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if it were me, I would have turned more to the right before entering the lane. This way, I could have made the turn smoothly without any issues.

**Speaker 1:** This part seems quite smooth. Did you feel the car accelerating?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about it?

**Speaker 2:** It was okay at the beginning. She didn't have the technique to accelerate quickly. If it were a young man, he might have accelerated more aggressively.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver handled the braking well?

**Speaker 2:** The braking was okay. When she was coasting, it was fine, but the final handling felt a bit rough. Initially, I thought it was the car's start-stop system, but it wasn't.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt a bit of a jolt when she braked.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt a slight jolt, but it wasn't a big issue. It didn't affect the ride too much.
**Speaker 1:**
So, when he braked, did you feel any bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did feel a bit of a jolt, but it wasn't a big issue. It didn't affect the ride too much.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, it's not a major problem, but it's something that could be improved.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**
Did he accelerate during this part?

**Speaker 2:**
It seemed like he was driving normally. The speed in this area is quite variable.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about it? This section seemed relatively smooth.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think it was because the road wasn't too complicated. Anyone could handle it.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you still paying attention to the road conditions during this part?

**Speaker 2:**
To be honest, not really, because the road was simple. There wasn't much to focus on. At this point, I was more concerned about other things. For instance, even though there were fewer cars, I was cautious about pedestrians or cyclists suddenly appearing from the right side.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you usually drive, do you adjust your focus based on the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you pay attention to this section?

**Speaker 2:**
I think he drove well here. He stayed within the lane, which is important because there were cars parked on the side.

**Speaker 1:**
Right.

**Speaker 2:**
It's crucial because doors can suddenly open, or someone might step out from between the cars. He was aware of this and adjusted his driving accordingly.

**Speaker 1:**
Did he slow down?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think he needed to. His speed was already appropriate.

**Speaker 1:**
So, he didn't need to slow down?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the distance was sufficient. He also considered the type of vehicles around, like larger trucks or buses, which require different handling.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think he maintained a good distance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
And with the tricycle as well?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was good.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice that the camera view seemed faster than what you saw in the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's true. The camera can be deceiving.

**Speaker 1:**
I saw you pressed the handle once. What was that about?

**Speaker 2:**
It was at this spot. I remembered that he kept the same speed even though there was a large vehicle, like a bus, ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think he should have slowed down?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because if someone suddenly appeared, it would have been difficult to react in time.
**Speaker 1:**
When he maintained the same speed as before, how did you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt he should slow down a bit. If someone suddenly appeared, you wouldn't be able to see them. So, if it were me, I would slow down, and I might even pull over since there were no cars around. I would at least leave a gap of two to three meters.

**Speaker 1:**
When you usually pass by large vehicles that might block your view, besides slowing down, do you have any other strategies? For example, do you tend to...

**Speaker 2:**
In the city, I keep a certain distance. In suburban areas, I usually maintain a steady speed.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 1:**
When he was following that car closely, how did you feel? Do you think he was doing the right thing?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, if it were me, I might follow closely too. But some people prefer to overtake. I think both following and overtaking are normal and acceptable.

**Speaker 1:**
When turning, do you pay attention to your surroundings? Do you look around?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I look both ways.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you pay attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually only pay attention once.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried here? It seemed like the tricycle was veering out a bit.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but I didn't think it was a problem because there were no other cars. The driver saw the situation and was aware. I kept an eye on it and adjusted my steering accordingly. I think I would have done the same.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't honk during that stretch?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't. I waited and let them pass.

**Speaker 1:**
But do you think there are details that could be improved?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it might also depend on the driver's personality.

**Speaker 1:**
That's okay. Feel free to share your subjective experience.

**Speaker 1:**
Here's another large vehicle. Did you use the horn this time?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't. It seemed to be the same vehicle as before.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried this time when passing by?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn't. Since it was the same vehicle, I didn't think there would be any issues. It's like when someone drives the same route to work every day; they do it mechanically without thinking. So, I think the driver was safe.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think this driver is safe?

**Speaker 2:**
I think he's okay.
**Speaker 1:** So, do you think this driver is safe?

**Speaker 2:** I think they're fairly safe.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any specific concerns?

**Speaker 2:** Minor ones, but overall, yes, they seem safe.

**Speaker 1:** Overall, you consider them safe. But as you mentioned, when passing large vehicles, attention to detail is crucial.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because balancing safety, comfort, and efficiency is important. The car can be driven faster, but the goal is to save time without compromising safety.

**Speaker 1:** What dimensions do you consider when defining safety?

**Speaker 2:** I think of safety in two aspects: personal safety and external safety. First and foremost, avoiding collisions.

**Speaker 1:** And for comfort, what do you think are the main factors?

**Speaker 2:** Comfort comes from two aspects. One is the safety data; if the car is driven safely, it feels comfortable. The other is the driving experience itself—no sudden braking, no rapid acceleration, and smooth turns. These all contribute to a comfortable ride.

**Speaker 1:** You also mentioned economic factors. How do you view them?

**Speaker 2:** Economic factors have two aspects. One is time efficiency—reaching the destination as quickly as possible while ensuring safety and comfort. The other is fuel efficiency—whether on highways or in the city, I aim to drive in a way that minimizes fuel consumption.

**Speaker 1:** Do you usually drive your child to school every day?

**Speaker 2:** Not every day.

**Speaker 1:** When you do drive your child to school, what is your priority?

**Speaker 2:** Safety, definitely. When driving my child, safety is the top priority.

**Speaker 1:** Does economic efficiency ever take precedence over comfort? For instance, when driving over speed bumps or manhole covers, do you prioritize speed over a smooth ride?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, sometimes. Overall, it's a balance. A slight bump over a manhole cover can be acceptable if it means saving time. It's a trade-off.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger in someone else's car, do you pay as much attention to road conditions as you did during today's experiment?

**Speaker 2:** It depends. If I'm familiar with the driver, I trust their handling. If I'm not familiar with the driver, I pay more attention.
**Speaker 1:** There are two scenarios. The first one is about familiarity. If I'm familiar with the driver, how do I handle it? If it's an unfamiliar driver, what do I do? If it's a driver I'm familiar with and they drive well, I can even sleep in the passenger seat. But if the driver isn't very good, I tend to pay more attention. And if the driver is unfamiliar, I will always keep an eye on them, even if they drive well.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, like when we travel for work, for example, to Chengdu, and we go to Jiuzhaigou, driving from Chengdu, especially on winding mountain roads, I always sit in the passenger seat to watch the driver. I'm afraid they might fall asleep or make a sudden turn, which could be dangerous. Even though I know they are more familiar with the road than I am, I still need to keep an eye on them because I don't know them well.

**Speaker 1:** So, you have a strong sense of safety. Do you always do this?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because sitting in the passenger seat, I've learned a lot from many tragic lessons and experienced drivers. It's always better to be cautious, especially with unfamiliar drivers.

**Speaker 1:** Would you choose someone with more experience than you to sit beside you and watch?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:** But for general city roads, you wouldn't be as worried?

**Speaker 2:** Correct. On city roads, first, there are fewer major traffic incidents. Second, people generally follow traffic rules in the city. These two factors ensure a certain level of safety.

**Speaker 1:** Now, back to this service, how do you think it maintains distance from nearby electric vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** I think it's fine. I mean, I can recall that it maintains a reasonable distance. It's not necessary to stick too close to the green belt unless there's a special situation. Otherwise, it could be problematic if you hit the curb. So, it's better to stay slightly to the left of the center of the road. I think that's a good choice.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think this road is safe, considering there are many electric vehicles going the wrong way?

**Speaker 2:** Mixed traffic is definitely unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** But the driver is handling it well?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think they are doing a good job.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver can make it through if they insist on going?

**Speaker 2:** They might honk the horn. If they can't get through, they might signal or tell you to move aside.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you think male drivers might honk at you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they might honk and even roll down their windows to ask why you're blocking the way and tell you that you shouldn't drive forward in that situation.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think he handled it well?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but you shouldn't drive like that. You should make a right turn immediately. Normally, you should drive straight, but in this case, you should have turned right.

**Speaker 1:**
And what about parking? Do you think there was an issue there?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the car shouldn't have been driven forward like that. You should first turn the steering wheel in this direction, then move the car parallel to the parking space. This way, there would be two parking spots available, not just one. So, he could have easily parked.

**Speaker 1:**
And then?

**Speaker 2:**
When he saw there was a car, he should have turned the wheel to the left a bit. It's like when you see a delivery truck, you should adjust accordingly. 

**Speaker 1:**
So, he should have kept a bit more distance, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Not just distance, but also the angle. The car should be positioned in a way that it's not parallel to the other car, otherwise, it would be difficult to park. Also, the young girl didn't check the rearview camera.

**Speaker 1:**
The rearview camera?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when she put the car in reverse, the screen should show the rearview. But she didn't check it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, she bumped into something?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
But you have experience, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what makes a good driver in your opinion?

**Speaker 2:**
A good driver combines safety, comfort, and efficiency. It's not about excelling in just one area. For example, if your safety is 100 but your comfort and efficiency are 0, that's not good. A balanced approach, like 80 in safety, 60 in comfort, and 80 in efficiency, is the best choice.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you consider yourself an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between you and a new driver? Experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Definitely experience.

**Speaker 1:**
And what advantage do you think your experience gives you in handling emergencies?
**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between you and them? Experience?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, definitely experience.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think your advantage over them is in handling emergencies, or is it in various aspects?

**Speaker 2:** It's not just that. I think it's more about mindset.

**Speaker 1:** Mindset.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because if you've driven over 200,000 kilometers, you rarely make those so-called rookie mistakes. You don't fuss over minor things.

**Speaker 1:** How was the driver's mindset today?

**Speaker 2:** I think because it was a test, and also because female drivers tend to be better in some aspects. Female drivers generally have the principle of not forcing things. If they can't move, they won't try to force it. They won't try to cut in front of others, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

**Speaker 1:** So, such situations won't occur.

**Speaker 2:** Right. But sometimes, when driving randomly, it's not about being proactive. It's just that there's no inherent difference in driving talent between men and women. So, my principle is that if it's your car and you're familiar with it, I would let you drive. I wouldn't drive it myself.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver was flustered when they made that sharp turn earlier?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't think so. They were following the traffic rules. If they couldn't make the turn, they would adjust and try again. In driving school, if you take too many tries, you might fail, but they focus on safety and following the rules. Experienced drivers wouldn't drive like that, which is why many experienced drivers struggle to pass the driving test again if their license is revoked.

**Speaker 2:** Because they have developed certain driving habits. For example, if they turn right and cross a solid line, that's not allowed. Solid lines are like walls; you can't cross them. But in real driving situations, it's not a wall. If I confirm there's no car within 50 meters behind me, I can make a slight adjustment without causing congestion. It's a balance of safety, efficiency, and comfort.

**Speaker 1:** Have you looked into autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I've been following it. Have you experienced it? No, I haven't tried it yet.

**Speaker 1:** Autonomous driving. What do you think about it?
**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever paid attention to autonomous driving? Have you experienced it before?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have been quite interested in autonomous driving. Have I experienced it? No, I haven't had the chance yet.

**Speaker 1:**
Based on your understanding of autonomous driving, what aspects do you think it will never be able to match human drivers in?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, as I mentioned earlier, safety, comfort, and economy are areas where it falls short because it can't make trade-offs. For example, if I need to drive a patient to the hospital, I would drive faster. But if I'm going to the countryside for leisure with my family, the driving style would be different. If I'm driving with my spouse and child, safety and rationality are my priorities. But if I'm driving with friends, the experience is different. Autonomous driving can't adapt to these nuances.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean...

**Speaker 2:**
I mean, if I'm driving with friends, it’s more about the experience. But with family, safety is paramount. A computer can't replicate this because it lacks emotions. It's like ChatGPT; it can never fully replace humans.

**Speaker 1:**
So, this is your general view on computers and AI, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, basically. I believe computers will never fully replace humans because humans can weigh different factors. Maybe in the future, AI will improve through algorithms and experience, but currently, it can't make complex judgments like a driver with 20 or 30 years of experience. A computer can only learn from historical data, but it can't handle unprecedented situations.

**Speaker 1:**
Your perspective is important.

**Speaker 2:**
I don't know if in the future AI will be able to handle situations it has never encountered before. For example, if there's a person on one side and a tree on the other, a human would instinctively choose to hit the tree to avoid harming the person. Can a computer make such a judgment? I don't know. Maybe in the future, it will improve, but for now, it can't handle these decisions well. It can only avoid known issues, but what if something unexpected happens?
Speaker 1: So, do you think it will be easier to judge in the future, but right now it's really hard to tell? 

Speaker 2: Yes, I think it's hard to judge at the moment. I try to avoid situations where I can't remember, but what if something unexpected happens?

Speaker 1: Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by an autonomous system? The entire trip, I mean.

Speaker 2: Since there were no extreme road conditions, I can't really tell. To distinguish between human and computer driving, you need special or extreme conditions.

Speaker 1: From an overall driving experience perspective, if we assume the vehicle you just rode in was indeed autonomous and the driver was just a safety officer pretending to drive, how would that compare to your usual riding experience?

Speaker 2: I don't think there's much difference.

Speaker 1: So, no noticeable changes?

Speaker 2: If it was autonomous driving, especially in the city, there shouldn't be any issues. In the city, it should be fine.

Speaker 1: Were there any details that made you momentarily think it might be a machine driving? Any such instances?

Speaker 2: Honestly, I can't say for sure. It could go either way. For example, the first time it moved, it hesitated a bit before proceeding, which could be a learning moment for the computer. It might have learned from the previous instance and adjusted accordingly. But humans can also learn and adjust. So, it could be either. If it was the computer, it means the algorithm is really good.

Speaker 1: When you're a pedestrian, how do you judge the intentions of drivers at an intersection without traffic lights?

Speaker 2: First, I look at the speed of the vehicle. Second, I check its direction and whether it's signaling.

Speaker 1: How do you decide to cross? Do you just go straight across?

Speaker 2: I make a judgment. First, I assess the speed to see if I can cross safely. Second, I check if the vehicle is signaling. If it's signaling a left turn, I can cross because it will turn left at the intersection.

Speaker 1: You mentioned you're a cautious person. Would you wait until there are no cars before crossing?
Speaker 1: Is the entrance a left turn? Okay, let's go over there.

Speaker 1: Earlier, you mentioned that you are a cautious person. Would you wait until there are no cars before you proceed, or would you slowly inch forward regardless of the traffic?

Speaker 2: I think it depends on the situation. I don't strictly follow traffic rules to the letter. If I did, I might never get through. I judge the speed of the oncoming cars and the distance. If I feel it's safe, I'll go.

Speaker 1: So, you still pay attention to the other cars, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2: By the way, if I knew the car was self-driving and controlled by a computer...

Speaker 1: You would be more daring?

Speaker 2: Yes, I would be more confident that it would yield to me. But with human drivers, you can't be sure.

Speaker 1: Alright, that concludes our questions. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.

Speaker 2: Thank you. You're welcome. Can I take this off now?

Speaker 1: Yes, you can.
