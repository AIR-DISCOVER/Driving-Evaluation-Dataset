**Speaker 1:**
Hello, can you hear me? I'm testing the audio.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, are we good to start? I'll begin with some basic questions about your daily routine. Do you often travel by car? How frequently do you use a car? Do you usually take taxis or drive yourself? For short trips, how long do they typically take? About half an hour? How did you find the vehicle we used for this trip to Chengdu? Overall, how did the vehicle feel to you? And what did you think of the driver's skills? Was the ride smooth? Did anything stand out to you? Did you feel uncomfortable at any point? When you travel, what type of vehicle do you prefer? SUVs, electric cars, gasoline cars, sedans, etc.?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually pay attention to the space inside the car? Do you drive yourself often? How would you rate your driving skills? Can you be more specific about what you mean by "average"? For example, do you find it challenging to drive during rush hour? Are you not very confident in your driving skills? Do you worry about road conditions?

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's review the recent trip you took. If there's any part of the video that stands out to you or if you have any thoughts about the driver's skills, feel free to mention it. How did you feel during the turns? Did you notice anything specific about the road conditions?

**Speaker 1:**
After the first segment of the drive, how did you feel about the turns? Did anything stand out to you?

**Speaker 2:**
The first time, I didn't notice much, but I saw that the other cars didn't handle the turns well either.

**Speaker 2:**
It was more about the acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Overall, the speed was quite steady.

**Speaker 1:**
When sitting in the back seat, did you focus more on your own comfort rather than looking outside?

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were more focused on your own experience rather than the outside environment. Does that align with your usual behavior?

**Speaker 1:**
Did you find the view from the front seat clearer? How did you feel about the road conditions near the red building during the shift?

**Speaker 1:**
Throughout the trip, did the driver perform any dangerous maneuvers? What do you consider to be dangerous driving? How can driving be made safer? Excluding this experiment, what do you think constitutes unsafe driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Unsafe driving involves certain behaviors.

**Speaker 1:**
What specific behaviors do you consider unsafe?
**Speaker 1:** Can you describe how the driving experiment was conducted? Specifically, what were the conditions?

**Speaker 2:** Well, excluding any unsafe conditions, everything was safe. What do you consider unsafe?

**Speaker 1:** Unsafe driving behaviors.

**Speaker 1:** For example, overtaking or navigating intersections at around 20,000 kilometers per hour. I see.

**Speaker 1:** So you think that speed changes can be unsafe?

**Speaker 1:** Are there any other driver behaviors that make you feel uncomfortable? Besides driving, for instance, their emotional state or verbal communication?

**Speaker 2:** Drinking alcohol, for example.

**Speaker 1:** Nowadays, it seems like drivers are often distracted, chatting with others. Is there anything a driver does that makes you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:** What about practical issues? Haha, how do you define safety? What does safety mean to you in terms of driving risks?

**Speaker 2:** Safety involves minimizing various risks, including natural and social risks.

**Speaker 1:** Can you talk about vehicle and technical risks?

**Speaker 2:** Technical risks involve driving skills, like sudden acceleration.

**Speaker 1:** It's important to conduct a pre-drive inspection.

**Speaker 2:** And consider human factors.

**Speaker 1:** Paying attention to pedestrians is also crucial for safety.

**Speaker 1:** What qualities do you think make a driver professional? What aspects should they excel in to be considered good and professional?

**Speaker 2:** Following rules is essential.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think there's a significant difference between novice and experienced drivers?

**Speaker 2:** What do you mean by that?

**Speaker 1:** Does the length of driving experience affect your perception of safety and comfort?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it does.

**Speaker 1:** What behaviors from other drivers make you feel uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** Drivers and pedestrians' actions, as well as sensory factors.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think there are aspects of driving that autonomous vehicles can't replicate compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there are certain human elements that autonomous driving can't match.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or an autonomous vehicle?

**Speaker 2:** I felt it was a human driver, but it could be because it was an experiment.

**Speaker 1:** If I told you the vehicle you were in was actually autonomous, with a safety driver present, would that change your perception?

**Speaker 2:** It might, but I didn't notice any specific moments that made me think it wasn't a human driver.

**Speaker 1:** What are your thoughts on the intelligence of autonomous driving systems?

**Speaker 2:** They need to be refined further.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about driving in general?
**Speaker 1:**
So, what do you think about the intelligence of the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think it's quite advanced.

**Speaker 2:**
When it comes to driving, I need to be more specific. Let's download it.

**Speaker 1:**
When you usually encounter an intersection without traffic signals, how do you determine whether a vehicle is a motor vehicle or a non-motor vehicle? Imagine you are a pedestrian crossing the street, and there are some vehicles around, both motorized and non-motorized. How do you judge their intentions? Do you decide to cross, stop, or make a left or right turn based on their behavior?

**Speaker 1:**
Would you choose to slowly observe their intentions, or would you directly decide to rush across or wait until they come to a complete stop? Okay, do you have any other questions or thoughts about today's experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
Basically, I think it's almost clear. Do you have any more questions for me?

**Speaker 1:**
Actually, I think in the future, it will be possible because these are very routine operations that don't require complex calculations. Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have any doubts or suggestions? Yes, we welcome your suggestions.
