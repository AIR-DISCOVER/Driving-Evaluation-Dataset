**Speaker 1:**
Before we start watching this video, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your daily travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I usually drive.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you drive more often. If you do take a ride, is it usually for long or short distances?

**Speaker 2:**
Short distances, typically.

**Speaker 1:**
How long are these short trips usually?

**Speaker 2:**
About half an hour to an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
So, between half an hour to an hour, right? How did you feel about riding in our vehicle for this experiment? How do you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
It was okay, just average.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer for traveling?

**Speaker 2:**
In terms of car type, I’d prefer a business car or an SUV.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Mainly for the space and the view.

**Speaker 1:**
Space and view. Do you have a preference between gasoline cars and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer gasoline cars. I’ve ridden in electric cars before, and sitting in the back makes me feel really nauseous.

**Speaker 1:**
You get car sick, right? Is it the same with all electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially in Shanghai. Almost all of them make me feel sick when I sit in the back. It’s a bit better in the front, but it also depends on the driver.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn’t feel sick in our car this time? Do you drive often yourself? How do you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I drive often. I think I’m pretty good.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I’ll play the video of our recent drive. If there are any moments that change your experience, feel free to point them out. I might also pause at certain points to ask about your feelings at that time.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, that sounds good. Just let me know before you start driving. It’s about 15 minutes, and we’ll reach our destination in about 18 minutes. In 80 meters, we’ll be near the destination. In 500 meters, turn right at the end of the road.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the car’s acceleration and turns? Any specific thoughts?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes, the car feels particularly smooth in certain areas, like when there’s enough space on both sides.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you use the handle when the car started?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe when the car was stopping. Sometimes, the braking felt abrupt, like it wasn’t a smooth press and release.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt it was jerky?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the braking was a bit sudden, causing a jolt.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt that the braking was a bit abrupt?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. When he braked, it felt like he was jerking the car. Also, when you mentioned turning left, it was about 150 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Entering the main road ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel that he was driving properly when he entered the service area?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite standard. About 10 meters ahead, he turned left. When we got onto the main road, it seemed like there was a lot of traffic, maybe because of some event.

**Speaker 1:**
How was the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
After the U-turn, we returned to the area near the Chinese Academy of Sciences. There might have been some obstacles on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about his driving on the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
He drove fine on the main road, not too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you use the handle during this segment? Was it when he made the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. I felt that he should have gone a bit further before making the U-turn. It seemed like he was at risk of hitting something. Later, when you asked me to take over, I remember his left front wheel scraped the curb.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it did scrape the curb?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was when he was trying to avoid a bicycle. He wanted to overtake but hesitated. I'll explain more when we get back.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel he was too close to the green belt?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, maybe because I'm used to driving an SUV. In such situations, I usually take a wider turn and then come back. I try to leave more space on the inside.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anxious or nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. If he could make the turn, he probably had it under control. But it was quite close.

**Speaker 1:**
But you still pressed the handle, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. It wasn't a big deal overall, just some minor things.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel him accelerating? Was the acceleration smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite smooth. The car felt a bit heavy, unlike electric cars that accelerate instantly. It was more linear.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you use the brake or handle during this segment?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the driver was braking too hard?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he seemed to have a habit of braking hard, like when the speed drops to around 2 or 5 mph, he would brake fully. Sometimes, it would be better to brake gently and then gradually slow down, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, he did that throughout the drive.

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel it was a big issue. Overall, his driving was fine.
Speaker 1: So, he should gradually press the pedal, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, he did that throughout the drive.

Speaker 1: I don't feel there's much to say about this part. The driving seemed fine. He reached the destination smoothly.

Speaker 1: During this segment, he maintained a constant speed. What do you think?

Speaker 2: Yes, the speed limit was 60, right? He was probably going close to 60. It seemed like he accelerated to that speed and then maintained it.

Speaker 1: How did he manage the distance between his car and the electric vehicles? He was about to arrive.

Speaker 2: It's hard to say. Generally, you can control your car, but you can't control others.

Speaker 1: Do you think he was within a safe range?

Speaker 2: Sometimes, definitely not.

Speaker 1: Did you use the handle?

Speaker 2: Yes, but he didn't make it difficult. You see, both parties were hesitating, and eventually, the other party let him go.

Speaker 1: Did you notice that part?

Speaker 2: Yes, I did.

Speaker 1: What do you think about the distance?

Speaker 2: It was a bit close. Both were hesitating about who should go first.

Speaker 1: Do you think he should have gone first or let the other car go?

Speaker 2: I think he should have waited behind the Mercedes and let the other car pass.

Speaker 1: So, he should have let the other car go first, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, because it was clear he couldn't avoid the car. He should have stopped and let the other car pass.

Speaker 1: So, for safety, he should have stopped.

Speaker 2: Especially since it was near a school.

Speaker 2: You see, in such situations, you should always give way, especially if you see pedestrians.

Speaker 1: Did you use the handle? Do you remember?

Speaker 2: I think I did, but I didn't press it hard.

Speaker 1: The data shows you pressed it lightly.

Speaker 2: I felt very anxious.

Speaker 1: When passing large vehicles that block your view, do you worry about pedestrians or cars suddenly appearing?

Speaker 2: Generally, not too much, especially if there's an intersection or bus stop. It's better to keep to the left to allow more reaction time. If you stick too close, you won't have time to react. Moving slightly to the left helps if there's no car on that side.

Speaker 1: Did the driver adjust the direction?

Speaker 2: Yes, I meant adjusting the direction slightly to the left.
**Speaker 1:** How did it go? Hmm, you mentioned that the next turn was to the left, and there were no cars on your side.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt the driver was in control.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mean the driver was steering correctly, even if someone suddenly appeared, they would react instinctively and drive normally?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Overall, I think C drove well today.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think it was safe?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was safe. Sometimes they hesitated a bit, but that's normal. They took a couple of loops around, but it was fine. On the way back, it was just that...

**Speaker 1:** Was it on the way back?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, right in front of the building. You don't have to be lazy or anything.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like it was within the city.

**Speaker 2:** No, it wasn't. For example, where I live, there might be some restrictions, but here, it's different.

**Speaker 1:** It should be behind us, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. When you turn at the main gate of the factory, you enter Zhongguancun North.

**Speaker 1:** Let's check the lanes when we turn. Do you think the turns were too sharp at the major intersections?

**Speaker 2:** No, the lanes were normal. We were about to turn right at the traffic light and then immediately reach the destination. Did we take a loop today?

**Speaker 1:** Did you pay attention to the road conditions in that area?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, because there were hardly any cars. My focus was on the right side as the co-driver. I tried to avoid any issues with the cars there.

**Speaker 1:** On other road sections, do you mainly focus on the right side as well?

**Speaker 2:** Generally, on the main road, I don't pay much attention. It's mainly on the auxiliary roads or when making turns.

**Speaker 1:** When turning, do you check behind you, like when making a right turn, do you look at the left rear?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I look at the left side.

**Speaker 1:** Because there might be cars coming from the opposite direction, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when making a right turn, you should check the left side. 

**Speaker 1:** Do you usually check that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do, but not too closely.

**Speaker 1:** Did you observe the driver's state today?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really observe them, but they were always looking at the road.

**Speaker 1:** Was the driver a woman? 

**Speaker 2:** Yes, she was very focused on the road, unlike some men who might glance more to the right or elsewhere.

**Speaker 1:** Do you usually feel that female drivers are more cautious?

**Speaker 2:** Not necessarily cautious, but they tend to keep looking straight ahead and rarely check the sides.

**Speaker 1:** Do you usually remind the driver verbally?

**Speaker 2:** In this case or generally?

**Speaker 1:** Just in general.

**Speaker 2:** Not really.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you pay attention to both sides while driving, or do you just glance quickly?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking about during the experiment or in general?

**Speaker 1:**
In general. But during the experiment, you couldn't speak, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct. You can just keep going straight; there's nothing much behind us since we made a loop and the data counts it as a left turn. Hmm, right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any bumps during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Other than the road itself, there shouldn't be any bumps. This is a 10.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver make you feel any bumps when going over speed bumps or manhole covers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there were some bumps.

**Speaker 1:**
Were the bumps very uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really. Unless we went over them too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the driver slowing down at any point? For example, near a landmark or before a turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. But you can hear the sound when the driver slows down, and you can see their right foot moving. Then they turn right. Hmm, then they try to move to the left, and sometimes the wheel scrapes a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Was there a particular moment that stood out to you?

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the overall speed was fast?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was just a normal speed. Approaching the intersection, it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you observe the side mirrors?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I only looked at the right front mirror because I couldn't see much else.

**Speaker 1:**
After making a U-turn, did you wait at the red light?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we waited at the red light.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the car's radar system alert you to any issues?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the radar detected something and slowed down a bit. It was the front left radar.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the car close to the one in front?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it wasn't close. The car just seemed small.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was just this section. Right, you mentioned...

**Speaker 2:**
I could hear the sound. Right turn, and then the woman...

**Speaker 1:**
Was it this car?

**Speaker 1:**
It was too close to the road.

**Speaker 2:**
No, there was a sound.

**Speaker 1:**
A clicking sound?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it sounded like she wanted to turn, but the woman turned towards me.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think the driver should have slowed down here?

**Speaker 2:**
Either that or honked, or just avoided the situation altogether. You should steer left in such cases.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he should have slowed down here?

**Speaker 2:**
Either that or honked, or anticipated the situation earlier. Or, he could have just avoided the hassle altogether. He was steering to the left, but there was no space on the left. With the cones set up, it was almost a single lane, so there wasn't much room to maneuver.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in the end...

**Speaker 2:**
In the end, he just slowly followed the person in front. He didn't really see where he was going.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you pressed the handle here, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did, but not very hard.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, and you think you didn't press it again afterward?

**Speaker 2:**
Later, when he was following the navigation into the parking lot, he should have turned right, but he turned slightly left instead. Is that correct?

**Speaker 1:**
We were behind him.

**Speaker 2:**
The seat followed him.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he should have honked here?

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, in my opinion, he should have honked. There wasn't a "no honking" sign, so regardless, he should have honked. But if you ask an experienced driver, they might say it's not necessary.

**Speaker 1:**
And here, he was close to this car.

**Speaker 2:**
This was just normal passing; there wasn't much room to give way. The radar beeped automatically, not because he was too close. He should have turned right and then immediately moved to the left.

**Speaker 2:**
Are you talking about this part?

**Speaker 2:**
He wanted to pass, but he wasn't going fast, so he just stopped there.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it when the bicycle appeared?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, at that moment.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean when he stopped?

**Speaker 2:**
Not exactly stopped, but when he was in the parking lot, he should have turned right. He turned late and hesitated, then reversed a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, then he made a sharp turn and reversed because the barrier might have already come down.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he didn't handle it well here, especially with the turn and distance management.

**Speaker 1:**
Apart from the scenarios you marked with the handle, was there anything else that made you feel unsafe or uncomfortable? No? Okay. Generally, when you're in someone else's car, what kind of driver behavior makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
What kind of behavior? I really can't stand it when I'm in the back seat and the driver accelerates or brakes suddenly. It makes me feel nauseous.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't like it when the driver drives too aggressively while you're in the back seat?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sudden acceleration or braking.

**Speaker 1:**
How about this time when you were in the front passenger seat?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. I've taken similar rides in Shanghai, like in a Roewe car.
**Speaker 1:**
So, how did you feel sitting in the front passenger seat this time?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. I remember taking a similar ride in Shanghai with an electric car, a Roewe. The driver was quite fast, and I almost kept my eyes closed the entire time, not even looking at my phone.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you only get car sick when sitting in the back seat?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other driving behaviors that bother you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, like aggressive driving, especially when competing with non-motorized vehicles. Sometimes, you have to be careful not to cut in front of them.

**Speaker 1:**
Like what you just mentioned?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, usually in such situations, I would honk. At night, I might use the headlights to signal.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else? No? So, what do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
You should accelerate when necessary and use the horn wisely, especially at intersections.

**Speaker 1:**
So, using the horn and signals at intersections to yield. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's about it. It's important to remember these things.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Not much, really. I rarely use ride-hailing services like Didi. Usually, it's just people I know driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, nothing specific about their driving?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really. But if the driver brakes too suddenly or harshly, it can be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Would it bother you if someone you know drove like that?

**Speaker 2:**
If they accelerate or brake too suddenly, it can be uncomfortable, but it depends on the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of driving makes you feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Driving smoothly without sudden stops. For example, when approaching a traffic light, gradually slow down instead of braking abruptly.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's all.

**Speaker 1:**
What qualities do you think make a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
What specific qualities? Well, a good driver should know when to drive fast and when to slow down. They shouldn't drive too slowly on clear roads and should avoid aggressive overtaking, especially in tricky situations.
**Speaker 1:**
So, when should you drive fast and when should you drive slow?

**Speaker 2:**
You should drive fast on normal, clear roads and avoid driving slowly without reason. Also, never forcefully overtake, especially in tricky situations. On narrow or winding roads, be cautious and give way to others. I think many people overuse their horns, which is completely wrong. You should only use the horn to alert pedestrians, not to disturb others.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you consider yourself an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I guess so. I've been driving for ten years.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between you and a new driver?

**Speaker 2:**
The main difference is in our driving awareness and observation skills. New drivers tend to be more nervous and might only focus on one thing at a time, like a computer that only understands 1s and 0s. They might either stare straight ahead or glance around nervously. With experience, you learn to check mirrors and be aware of your surroundings more naturally. It's like second nature. For example, when reversing, you need to understand the car as a rectangular object and maneuver accordingly.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you looked into autonomous driving? What do you think about it?

**Speaker 2:**
In ideal conditions, like on clear roads, it's absolutely fine. However, in more complex environments, it might recognize a car but not predict its movements accurately. A human driver might decide to slow down or honk, but the system might not react the same way. My car has some autonomous features, which are useful on highways or in traffic jams. But in more unpredictable situations, it can still lag a bit in response.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you use it often?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very often, only when driving at speeds above 70-80 km/h.

**Speaker 1:**
So, mainly on highways?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and on ring roads where you can maintain a steady speed. It follows the car in front, keeping a distance of about 100 meters. If a car cuts in, it will gradually slow down to maintain a safe distance, rather than braking suddenly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if something suddenly jumps out in front, it won't brake abruptly?

**Speaker 2:**
If everything is moving smoothly, it will slow down if something cuts in, but it won't make a sudden stop.
**Speaker 1:** If something suddenly jumps out in front of the car, it won't brake abruptly, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if something suddenly appears while the car is moving, it will slow down but won't make a sudden stop.

**Speaker 1:** Besides these aspects, in what other ways do you think autonomous driving will never surpass human driving?

**Speaker 2:** One major aspect is anticipation. Humans have the ability to predict and react to situations in ways that autonomous systems can't. For example, humans can use high-precision maps, recognize lane markings, and understand road conditions to make driving easier. The system might handle some of these tasks, but you still need to be ready to take control, like keeping your foot near the brake.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** Based on the experience, it felt like a human was driving.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:** Well, if it were autonomous driving, especially on a main road with clear lane markings, the system would follow the lines and avoid obstacles well in advance. Autonomous systems have a design logic that keeps a safe distance from objects and maintains lane discipline, trying to stay centered in the lane.

**Speaker 1:** So, during today's drive, you felt the driver wasn't following these patterns?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, in situations like the one we just discussed, whether it's autonomous or human driving, the system would anticipate and avoid obstacles without forcing its way through. It recognizes the surroundings and ensures you don't collide with anything.

**Speaker 1:** Let's assume the car you were in was using autonomous driving, and the driver was just a safety operator pretending to drive. How would this compare to your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 2:** There wouldn't be much difference. The service handling would be similar.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any details that made you think the car might not be driven by a human?

**Speaker 2:** It felt a bit cold and impersonal, unlike a human driver.

**Speaker 1:** So, nothing specific?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. For instance, during a U-turn, a human driver might slightly touch the curb or cross a solid line, but an autonomous system would stay centered in the lane and avoid crossing double solid lines.

**Speaker 1:** One more question: as a pedestrian...
**Speaker 1:**
I have another question. As a pedestrian, if you are crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the oncoming vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
At an intersection without traffic lights?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, without traffic lights.

**Speaker 2:**
If a car is approaching, I usually assume it will let me pass. For example, if the car is far enough away, I might just run across the street quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you determine if the driver intends to let you pass?

**Speaker 2:**
It's really hard to judge. You can't always predict a driver's intentions. For instance, at Wudaokou, near the subway station, during rush hour, I often have to let pedestrians pass regardless of the traffic lights. People just keep crossing, and I have to slowly inch forward. Occasionally, a fast driver might stop abruptly, and then the cars behind will follow suit.

**Speaker 1:**
So, as a pedestrian, how do you cross an intersection without traffic signals?

**Speaker 2:**
If the car is far away, I might jog across. 

**Speaker 1:**
What if you are halfway across and the car suddenly doesn't yield? Would you wait in the middle of the road?

**Speaker 2:**
No, if the car doesn't yield, it would hit me. I would either move forward or step back. Generally, in such situations, people tend to move to the side. If a driver doesn't yield, they might cause an accident. For example, if a driver swerves to avoid a cone and forgets to check for pedestrians, it could lead to a collision.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would slowly make your way across?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would carefully observe the traffic and wait for a clear gap before crossing.

**Speaker 1:**
You wait for a moment when there are no cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
If there is a line of cars, you would weave through them?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the cars are stopped in a traffic jam, I would weave through them.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, that concludes our interview. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.
