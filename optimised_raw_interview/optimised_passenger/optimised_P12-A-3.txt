**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's get started. I'll ask you a few questions. Do you often travel by car? How many times a week approximately?

**Speaker 2:**
About three times a week.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of vehicles do you usually take? Do you often take the subway for short trips? How about long-distance travel? How often do you go on long trips?

**Speaker 2:**
I take long trips about two to three times a year. For short trips, I usually travel for about 40 minutes or so.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the vehicle you took this time? How was your experience?

**Speaker 2:**
The car was a bit more aggressive compared to what I'm used to.

**Speaker 1:**
More aggressive than a taxi?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it might be related to the fact that I was using a ride-hailing service.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
For a beginner, it's fine. But the driver has a habit of accelerating too quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
Did this aggressive acceleration make you feel uncomfortable or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
When the road was crowded with cars and people, I felt a bit uneasy. I was more worried about the driver hitting someone than about my own safety.

**Speaker 1:**
But it wasn't uncomfortable enough for you to use the emergency handle?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it wasn't.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of vehicle do you prefer for your travels? For example, an SUV, an electric car, or a gasoline car?

**Speaker 2:**
I would prefer an electric car.

**Speaker 1:**
Why an electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel that electric cars are more stable.

**Speaker 1:**
You drive yourself as well. How would you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I'm okay, especially in terms of safety.

**Speaker 1:**
So you feel confident about your safety skills. Now, let's review the route you just took. If there were any memorable points or places where you felt uncomfortable, please let me know.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, especially in narrow areas.

**Speaker 1:**
During this process, I'll also ask questions as we go along. How did you feel about the navigation and turns?

**Speaker 2:**
When we were about to turn right, and then 150 meters ahead, we had to merge into the main road.

**Speaker 2:**
We were near the South Lake area. After 150 meters, we had to move to the left.

**Speaker 2:**
Then we had to merge into the main road.

**Speaker 2:**
We were about 100 meters away from our destination.
**Speaker 1:**  
You are about to enter the main road.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are near the South Lake Classic area. In 150 meters, keep left. Almost there.

**Speaker 2:**  
Keep left to enter the main road.

**Speaker 2:**  
In 100 meters, you will reach a waypoint.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are about to reach the South Lake Classic. After that, make a U-turn at the traffic light. Near the South Lake Classic, then make a U-turn at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:**  
How do you feel about making a U-turn at this point?

**Speaker 2:**  
The U-turn was very smooth. I had to adjust a bit, but it went through in one go. In 300 meters, you will reach the South Lake Classic.

**Speaker 2:**  
But wasn't there some interference? Yes, we are about to reach the waypoint, then turn right near the classic area, then turn right smoothly. Hmm, no problem.

**Speaker 1:**  
The whole process was very smooth, right? No bumps or anything. In 300 meters, you will reach the classic area.

**Speaker 2:**  
There are just two places I need to mention.

**Speaker 1:**  
We are about to reach the scenic spot, you can mention it in a bit.

**Speaker 2:**  
Turn right at the traffic light. Near the South Lake Classic, then turn right at the traffic light.

**Speaker 2:**  
Turn right in 400 meters to reach the Tokyo point.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are about to reach the same scenic spot, then turn left at the end of the road. Near the South Lake Classic, then turn left at the end of the road.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel when passing through these intersections?

**Speaker 2:**  
The road was quite narrow, especially at that point ahead.

**Speaker 1:**  
Were you worried about anything in particular?

**Speaker 2:**  
Because the driver was quite aggressive, I was afraid he might scrape against something.

**Speaker 1:**  
Were you scared? Or were you more concerned about the driver's actions rather than your own safety?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, turning left. It made me a bit uneasy.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are about to reach the South Lake Classic. In 100 meters, there is a traffic violation camera.

**Speaker 2:**  
If you say he is a professional driver, I would still feel a bit uncomfortable. You are about to reach the same scenic spot, then turn right near the classic area, then turn right into Zhongguancun North Second Street. Keep to the right lane. In 200 meters, turn right at the traffic light. Keep to the right lane, turn right at the traffic light, then immediately reach the classic area. Turn right, then immediately reach the classic area.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are near the South Lake Classic. In 300 meters, you will reach the South Lake Classic.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are about to reach the classic area, then turn right. Near the South Lake Classic, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel when the pedestrian was crossing the road just now?

**Speaker 2:**  
The pedestrian kept looking at our car. Hmm, nothing special. We reached the Beijing point, then turned right.

**Speaker 2:**  
Turn right into Zhongguancun. In 300 meters, you will reach the classic area. In 100 meters, there is a traffic violation camera.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are about to reach the scenic spot, then turn left. The current speed allows you to pass through the upcoming intersection to reach the South Lake Classic, then turn left.

**Speaker 2:**  
You are about to reach the South Lake Classic. Go straight through the current traffic light. In 150 meters, you will reach the same scenic spot. You are about to reach the classic area. Near the South Lake Classic.
**Speaker 1:** After that, turn left.

**Speaker 2:** We're almost there.

**Speaker 2:** Near the Classic Route. Continue straight through the current traffic light, and in 150 meters, you'll reach the same spot. We're almost at Kingdee. Once you reach the Classic Route, turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road. Turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road.

**Speaker 2:** Stay on the main road, and in 400 meters, make a U-turn at the intersection. There was a call, and someone was taking pictures of pedestrians. Move to the left lane, and in 250 meters, make a U-turn at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:** Is there any other place we need to go?

**Speaker 2:** Please stay in the leftmost lane. When making the U-turn, he stepped on the brake. I thought we were going to take the side road. Why is he driving so fast? The roadside is quite narrow, but it's normal.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's the U-turn. Is it the same place where we made the U-turn initially?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that place. Oh, are we back?

**Speaker 2:** He stepped on the brake. Yes, a sudden brake. Then, he made a U-turn into the side road.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver? What do you think is a safer way to drive in general?

**Speaker 2:** When changing lanes, you need to check both sides. He was driving quite aggressively. When changing lanes, I felt he was... Right turn, then immediately move to the left lane.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think about cyclists going against traffic? Do you have any thoughts on that? The cyclist wasn't going against traffic; it was a right turn, then move to the left lane. There was a cyclist just now, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he stepped on the brake at that moment.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, he stepped on the brake there, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, at that spot.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about him stepping on the brake?

**Speaker 2:** My feeling was that the driver should have been more cautious and made a right turn 10 meters earlier.

**Speaker 1:** But he was still driving quite fast.

**Speaker 2:** Otherwise, the sudden brake wouldn't have happened.

**Speaker 2:** We're about to turn right, then immediately...

**Speaker 1:** Turn right, then immediately turn right again. Are we back? Yes, when you're a passenger, what kind of driver behavior makes you feel unsafe, aside from this experiment?

**Speaker 2:** Outside of this experiment?

**Speaker 1:** Yes. This is reckless acceleration, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's reckless acceleration. On the highway, you can't drive slowly, but in blind spots or narrow roads, driving fast feels unsafe for both the driver and the car, and it's unsafe for others on the road.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define safety? If you were to define a safety line, what would it be?

**Speaker 2:** Avoid accidents. Some minor incidents are inevitable, but don't rush like a delivery driver.

**Speaker 1:** It's about reaction speed, the ability to respond to emergencies.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there should be some anticipation beforehand.

**Speaker 1:** So, in this experiment, did the driver do anything that made you...
**Speaker 1:** Reaction speed is essentially the ability to respond to emergency situations.

**Speaker 2:** I think there should be some anticipation beforehand.

**Speaker 1:** In this experiment, did the driver's actions make you feel uncomfortable at any point? No? Okay. How about when you're a passenger in someone else's car? Are there any behaviors that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Honestly, yes. For example, my family member has been driving for only two or three years, and when he drives, I feel uneasy. But if it's a colleague who has been driving for over ten years, I don't mind if they drive fast. Sometimes, I even prefer it because I'm in a hurry. However, after a while, I might still feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** So, you feel it's not very safe, right? Do you have any specific criteria for comfort?

**Speaker 2:** Just like today.

**Speaker 1:** Really? Anything else besides today?

**Speaker 2:** The noise inside the car was a bit loud today.

**Speaker 1:** The noise from the engine, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes. Other than that, the temperature was fine today. The rear space was also adequate for my height.

**Speaker 1:** That's all, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** Do you consider yourself a new driver or an experienced one?

**Speaker 2:** Just average.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between new drivers and experienced ones?

**Speaker 2:** New drivers tend to drive slowly at first, but after a while, they might drive too aggressively. The transition is quite drastic. Experienced drivers are generally more stable; they drive slowly when needed and maintain a steady speed on highways, often close to the speed limit.

**Speaker 1:** So, they have excellent speed control.

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a driver truly professional? What qualities or skills are necessary?

**Speaker 2:** It depends on the road conditions. On familiar roads, stability is key.

**Speaker 1:** What about other types of roads?

**Speaker 2:** On long-distance trips, it's important to drive faster and not too slowly.

**Speaker 1:** What does "slow" mean in your dialect?

**Speaker 2:** It means driving slowly.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think there are aspects of driving that autonomous cars will never be able to match compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Autonomous driving has its trends, but it can't fully replicate human driving.

**Speaker 1:** So, even in the future, what aspects do you think autonomous cars will still fall short of compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** I haven't thought about it in detail, but I feel that in the future, autonomous cars might even surpass human drivers.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, so you have a lot of confidence in their potential.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially with traffic lights and vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
**Speaker 1:**
Oh, so you really trust it.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, with traffic lights and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, it might even outperform humans because humans can get tired.

**Speaker 1:**
That's what you think, huh?

**Speaker 2:**
I believe it will surpass human capabilities.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think the journey you just took was driven by a human or an autonomous vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
At first, I thought it was a human driving. My initial thought was that someone was holding the steering wheel. But then the car seemed to be driving itself. Later, as we approached the station, I felt it was a human driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Why did you have that feeling?

**Speaker 2:**
The initial acceleration was quite abrupt, which made me think it might be a female driver. But then, when the car was supposed to turn right, it turned left and then corrected itself. That's when I thought it might be a human driving, or maybe it was a mix of autonomous and human driving. But the last part was definitely human-driven.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any moments when you thought it was definitely autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when we first got onto the main road from the side road, the U-turn was executed very smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
Very stable at that point.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if the vehicle you were in was actually autonomous, with a safety driver pretending to drive, how would that compare to your usual experience?

**Speaker 2:**
If it was autonomous, it felt a bit more aggressive than a professional driver.

**Speaker 1:**
In what other ways?

**Speaker 2:**
In narrow areas, it was more aggressive. It didn't seem to anticipate as well, making sudden stops. Some human drivers do that too, but it's acceptable.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Now, as a pedestrian, how do you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles or cars at an intersection without traffic lights? Do you look at the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I make eye contact with the driver. If the car is slowing down and the driver sees me, I'll cross. I don't just look at the car.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you take a comprehensive look at the situation. Do you also observe the actions of other pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely. I always consider the behavior of other pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you ever just cross the street regardless of what the cars are doing?
**Speaker 1:**  
So, do you think that in the future, traditional gender roles will still influence driving behavior?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**  
Would you choose to just drive straight through regardless of the traffic, or would you adjust your driving?

**Speaker 2:**  
I wouldn't just drive straight through. I would be cautious.

**Speaker 1:**  
Would you prefer to stop and wait until there are no cars before proceeding?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I would observe the situation first.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you would wait until the cars have completely passed before you move, or would you slowly approach the intersection?

**Speaker 2:**  
I would approach the entrance and observe. If the cars are moving slowly, I would proceed. If they are moving at a steady and fast pace, I would let them pass first. If the car doesn't show any sign of slowing down, there's no need to compete with it.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you would pay attention to the speed of the cars?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I would watch the speed of the cars.

**Speaker 1:**  
Got it. What is your definition of intelligence in this context?

**Speaker 2:**  
Intelligence?

**Speaker 1:**  
Or rather, how do you define autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**  
My definition is that it's not just about the car driving itself. It's about everything being interconnected, like the concept of the Internet of Things. True automation means that not only the car but also the surrounding environment and people follow the rules. If others don't follow the rules, it won't work effectively.

**Speaker 1:**  
Oh, I see. Let's focus on the car itself for now. What do you think about the current state of autonomous vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**  
I find it quite interesting. I think it's a trend that will continue to develop in the future.

**Speaker 1:**  
What aspects do you think make a car truly intelligent?

**Speaker 2:**  
The intelligence of the car itself has already been developed quite well by major manufacturers. Most of the features we see now are already quite advanced. If I had to point out something new, it might not be at that level yet.

**Speaker 1:**  
Just share your understanding.

**Speaker 2:**  
In my understanding, a car's intelligence should prioritize safety first. Without safety, all the data and features wouldn't matter. Besides safety, comfort is also important.

**Speaker 1:**  
What aspects of comfort are you referring to?

**Speaker 2:**  
Modern intelligent cars are much more comfortable than traditional fuel cars. The seats, the climate control systems, and other features make them more comfortable. Even traditional fuel cars are starting to adopt these features.

**Speaker 1:**  
Are there any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:**  
There are many intelligent features in cars now. It's hard to think of something new because most of what I can think of is already implemented in cars.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, that's basically it?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:**  
Alright, that concludes our interview for today. Do you have any questions or suggestions for us?
**Speaker 1:**
So, that's basically it, right? OK, then we'll wrap up today's interview here. Do you have any questions or suggestions for us?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, my question is about that segment earlier. How much of it was actually automated driving?

**Speaker 1:**
There was no automated driving; it was all manual.

**Speaker 2:**
I see.

**Speaker 1:**
Automated driving is not allowed on that stretch of road.

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, automated driving doesn't always feel smooth. Over in Yizhuang, it seems like they often test it. I frequently see them on Longjin East Street.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, they use that kind of equipment, right? Haha, well, I think we're about done here. Thank you.

**Speaker 2:**
No other issues.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, right, right. OK, thank you. I'll turn off the microphone now.
