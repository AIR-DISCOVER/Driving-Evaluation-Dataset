**Speaker 1:**
Alright, before we start watching the video, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, quite often.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it usually long-distance or short-distance travel?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short-distance.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do these trips usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
About half an hour or less.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about riding in our vehicle for this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking about the overall experience? Yes, it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
How was the driver's skill?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very good, to be honest. It was quite obvious that he was either nervous or something else was off. There were issues when he had to make a U-turn, brake, or take a turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you could tell the driver was nervous in these situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, in simple scenarios, his driving skills seemed problematic. It wasn’t clear if it was because of nerves or something else, but it was noticeable.

**Speaker 1:**
It felt like the driver’s skills were not up to par?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes he braked too hard. It seemed like he wasn’t very confident. For example, when he needed to change lanes, he would signal first and then check the mirrors, which seemed a bit off.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it felt like he wasn’t clear on the steps he needed to take?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe it’s just his habit, but it didn’t feel right.

**Speaker 1:**
How could you tell he was nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn’t see him being nervous directly, but I noticed he was sweating a lot, which made me think he was quite tense. He was also very focused on the screen.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn’t nervous.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer to travel in?

**Speaker 2:**
What are the options?

**Speaker 1:**
You can choose between different car models and types, like an SUV.

**Speaker 2:**
I usually drive an SUV when I go out.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you’re used to driving an SUV?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it’s more spacious and has better power.

**Speaker 1:**
What about fuel cars versus electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually drive a fuel car, but I’m open to both options.
**Speaker 1:**
So, regarding gasoline cars and electric cars, do you have any thoughts?

**Speaker 2:**
I have a single video about gasoline cars, but it's not good. I prefer to choose freely.

**Speaker 1:**
I mean, in terms of the riding experience.

**Speaker 2:**
In terms of the riding experience, I feel that gasoline cars offer a much better experience compared to electric cars.

**Speaker 1:**
The electric car experience is poor?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I rode in a Tesla, and I felt that even after charging for a whole day, it still had a large sunroof, which might not be ideal in a city like Beijing where it can get very sunny.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I've driven several tens of thousands of kilometers and haven't had any accidents. I also haven't received any tickets, so I think I'm doing okay.

**Speaker 1:**
You've driven tens of thousands of kilometers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I often drive when traveling with friends, for example, in Xinjiang or Gansu.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you have quite a bit of driving experience.

**Speaker 2:**
It's alright.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's take a look at the driving video we just recorded. While watching, if you notice any changes in your experience or if you feel any part is unsafe, please let me know.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, I'll let you know if I notice any changes.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if you think a certain section of the road is dangerous or if the driver didn't handle something well, feel free to point it out.

**Speaker 2:**
Got it. If there are any issues, I'll mention them.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when the driver started the car?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much, just a normal start.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was a normal start. After about 60 meters, there was a left turn followed by an immediate right turn. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
At that spot, the radar beeped, but it was because the car was too close to the left, near a motorcycle.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried it might hit the motorcycle?

**Speaker 2:**
After 60 meters, there was a left turn. At that moment, I wasn't sure how the driver would handle it. I didn't know his skill level yet.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were still observing the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was. He didn't do anything special, just veered a bit too much to the left.

**Speaker 1:**
Did he slow down a bit? Did you feel the driver didn't control the distance well while turning?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you can see from the video that the car was clearly veering to the left. The right side of the road was quite wide.

**Speaker 1:**
When he was making those turns out of the parking lot, how did you feel about the way he handled the turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes, when making turns, he braked a lot. For example, he would stop before turning, which might not be necessary in some positions.
**Speaker 1:**
So, sometimes when turning, they brake a lot, right? They stop before the turn, and even when the road conditions are good, they take a long time to look to the left. They should be making a right turn, but they just stop there. Maybe it's a good driving habit, but it seems excessive.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it feels like the driver is a bit hesitant. But you can tell this hesitation is for safety reasons.

**Speaker 1:**
I don't know what their reasoning is. Maybe it's just different driving habits. For example, if it were me, I would just make the right turn directly. But they stop and wait until everything is clear before moving again.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you mean they brake heavily when turning?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, for example, just before they turn, they brake hard to slow down. It creates a feeling of abruptness.

**Speaker 2:**
Is it uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
It's not too bad, but they do brake hard. When approaching a right turn, they slow down, but not too quickly. The speed isn't fast to begin with.

**Speaker 2:**
So, the overall speed isn't fast?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, at normal speeds, braking shouldn't be that abrupt. It's only when braking hard that it feels uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you think the driver handles right turns?

**Speaker 1:**
It's normal. But when there are more obstacles, it becomes more challenging.

**Speaker 2:**
When there are more obstacles, it seems like they struggle a bit. If they were driving for a ride-hailing service, it might be problematic.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they need more practice?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they need more practice. In 150 meters, turn left. Their driving style seems safe on the surface, but it might be due to inexperience or nervousness.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you talking about their service?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, their driving habits show they are very cautious. But I don't think it's just caution; they might be inexperienced or too nervous.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, they do seem very nervous.

**Speaker 2:**
You can tell by their heart rate.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, our other data shows it too. They sweat a lot.

**Speaker 2:**
I noticed that when they first got out of the car, their underarms were completely wet. Also, when driving on normal roads, they seem hesitant.

**Speaker 1:**
They don't seem confident.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, this hesitation can cause problems. It's not caution; it's indecision.
**Speaker 1:** He seemed quite hesitant. Sometimes, when driving, you need to be decisive. Hesitation can cause problems. This isn't caution, in my opinion.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's hesitation. His driving style is quite different from yours.

**Speaker 1:** Is it very different? I don't think I would drive like that.

**Speaker 2:** No, you wouldn't drive like that. Overall, how did you find his service?

**Speaker 1:** For normal driving, it was fine. He could drive straight without any issues. But when it came to handling road conditions, there were problems. For instance, when merging onto the main road, he should have just steered left.

**Speaker 2:** And what about lane changes?

**Speaker 1:** I don't remember if he used the turn signals.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, you don't remember?

**Speaker 1:** No, you might want to check the vehicle's records. He might have forgotten to use the signals. I didn't pay close attention to that.

**Speaker 2:** Is this a one-time thing or does it happen often?

**Speaker 1:** I think it happens often. You might want to check other vehicles as well. It seems to be a pattern.

**Speaker 2:** Did you hear any sounds in the car?

**Speaker 1:** I don't think so. Either he didn't use the turn signals, or I didn't notice.

**Speaker 2:** Not using turn signals is unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it's standard practice to use them. Even in Beijing, you need to use turn signals. He should have signaled before changing lanes.

**Speaker 2:** He was a bit slow in changing lanes, and then at the traffic light, he made a U-turn.

**Speaker 1:** Did he reach the designated point?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but the U-turn was problematic.

**Speaker 1:** Did the radar alert you?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not sure if the radar went off, but he made the U-turn and then had to reverse.

**Speaker 1:** He couldn't make the turn in one go. Did he brake suddenly?

**Speaker 2:** I don't think so. He had already slowed down before. Why would he brake suddenly?

**Speaker 1:** I saw the front of the car move.

**Speaker 2:** It should be fine. The speed was very low. When reversing, there was a car approaching from the side. I was a bit worried.

**Speaker 1:** Were you concerned about the other cars?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I was a bit worried, haha.

**Speaker 1:** Why didn't you use the horn? Even if you were concerned about the driver's feelings.

**Speaker 2:** We were trying to be considerate of the driver's feelings.
**Speaker 1:**
Why didn't you use the handle? Even though you felt the driver was...

**Speaker 2:**
We were trying to be considerate of the driver's feelings. If you use the handle, it might make him even more nervous. He already seemed a bit tense, and using the handle could increase his anxiety.

**Speaker 1:**
Actually...

**Speaker 2:**
He didn't know what the handle was for.

**Speaker 1:**
He would only realize after driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. I think you should improve this next time. For example, inform the driver beforehand that the handle is there for safety and not to worry about it. Otherwise, using it might increase his stress.

**Speaker 1:**
That's true. So, when you reached that point, you noticed the driver was very nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite obvious. He wasn't very familiar with the route. It wasn't about whether he was simple or not; he just wasn't experienced. You could see he was not confident in his driving. At that point, it might have been better to stop and switch drivers. We were approaching a classic route, then a right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the driving normal on this road?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, nothing unusual here.

**Speaker 1:**
And the turn was also normal?

**Speaker 2:**
300 meters to the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned the more complex road conditions were later on.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the more complicated part was near the elementary school and Xiaolong Lake. Approaching the waypoint, then a right turn at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:**
There was no acceleration here, just a consistent speed during the right turn.

**Speaker 2:**
He wasn't driving fast to begin with, right? Right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
The right turn felt normal, about 400 meters to the waypoint.

**Speaker 2:**
What do you think his speed was throughout the trip?

**Speaker 1:**
Around 60 km/h, was it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, around 60 km/h. It didn't feel like 80 km/h, more like 60 km/h.

**Speaker 1:**
We can't see it now, but we wanted to ask the passenger.

**Speaker 2:**
I checked the dashboard, and it seemed to be around 60 km/h, maybe 50-60 km/h. Approaching the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:**
It didn't feel like a fast road.

**Speaker 2:**
It was a normal driving speed, which should be around that range.

**Speaker 1:**
There were a few speed bumps. Is this the elementary school you mentioned?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it's further ahead. Approaching the waypoint, then a left turn at the end of the road, and then reaching the classic route.

**Speaker 1:**
Is the left turn here particularly sharp?

**Speaker 2:**
100 meters to the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:**
The road conditions here are quite standard.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there weren't many cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Approaching the waypoint, then a left turn.

**Speaker 1:**
There seemed to be more cars on this stretch. Were you worried about the driver handling any sudden situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was concerned about how he would handle unexpected events.
**Speaker 1:**
There seemed to be quite a lot of cars on this stretch. Were you worried about the driver at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. There shouldn't have been any issues, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Right, there weren't any issues because we were quite far away from other cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the road was wide, and there were no oncoming cars. Is this a one-way street? It should be, right? I was worried about the driver, but everything turned out fine. In 400 meters, we reached the destination without any problems.

**Speaker 1:**
The driver handled the regular roads quite well, but it got a bit congested.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, as long as the traffic is normal, there are no issues. However, when the road conditions get a bit more complicated, he might get a bit nervous, worrying about potential problems.

**Speaker 1:**
On this road, he kept a good distance from the other cars, right?

**Speaker 2:**
We are about to reach the waypoint, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the driver accelerating significantly on any particular stretch?

**Speaker 2:**
I can't remember exactly because it has been a while. Maybe when we were getting off the car.

**Speaker 1:**
I have a vague memory of it. There wasn't any sudden braking when we got off.

**Speaker 2:**
Turn right. If you ask me where he accelerated, I can't recall.

**Speaker 1:**
Turn right here. He should wait a bit.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he waited for a long time. He should have turned right after moving forward a bit. Other cars should wait for him to turn right, or he should position himself to turn right and then stop. If other cars keep moving, he would have to keep waiting.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver was too hesitant here?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe, but he was trying to be safe. Please stay in the right lane. Turn right at the traffic light in 200 meters.

**Speaker 2:**
Please stay in the right lane. Turn right at the traffic light, and then immediately reach the destination.

**Speaker 1:**
Does his hesitation make you feel uncomfortable? Because he could have moved forward quickly.

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. I just hoped he would drive a bit faster, but safely.

**Speaker 1:**
Hesitation doesn't necessarily mean being safe. When he was stopped, did you worry about any safety issues?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. I just felt that his driving style was such that he would stop and wait, and if other cars didn't move, he couldn't either. You can't force your way through, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Turning right here is normal.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and as we mentioned earlier, if he stops slowly and then turns right, if an oncoming car is fast, it could be problematic.
**Speaker 1:** Turning is also normal, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but at the beginning, for example, if he stops slowly and then turns right, what if a car comes quickly from the other direction? Because he turns right a bit slowly, the car behind might see him moving slowly and might not brake in time, potentially causing a collision.

**Speaker 1:** So there is still some risk.

**Speaker 2:** In about 300 meters, we will reach the waypoint. Gantson, the place where many people ride bicycles, near that elementary school.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I think so.

**Speaker 2:** I felt he was a bit nervous. You can check the new route later. You can also look at the new area.

**Speaker 1:** How could you tell he was nervous? Was he sweating?

**Speaker 2:** I felt that he was driving slowly, maybe because he was cautious. He slowed down when approaching a person or another car. I think it's reasonable; he might be afraid of causing an accident, so he drove more carefully during that period.

**Speaker 1:** So you could tell from his speed?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you could tell from his speed. We should have been on this road.

**Speaker 1:** This road is relatively clear.

**Speaker 2:** In 300 meters, we will reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like there is an acceleration here, right? He accelerated a bit.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a bit of acceleration is reasonable since there are no cars ahead.

**Speaker 1:** His acceleration was smooth. It should be fine as there was no sudden acceleration or deceleration. Was it like that the whole time?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we are near the waypoint, and then we will turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Turning right here feels normal.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it feels normal.

**Speaker 1:** There was a bump just now; did we go over a manhole cover or something?

**Speaker 2:** I don't remember.

**Speaker 1:** It's not a big deal, nothing special.

**Speaker 2:** We are about to reach the waypoint, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:** On such roads, can I reverse? There is an illegally parked car on this narrow road. How do you think the driver handled it?

**Speaker 2:** It was fine, then turned right.

**Speaker 1:** I think this driver seems like a novice.

**Speaker 2:** It's a bit chaotic, maybe because he is new to driving. In 400 meters, we will reach the waypoint, and there is a speed camera 100 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:** But he has been driving for a few years.

**Speaker 2:** Is it a private car?

**Speaker 1:** It's not convenient to say, but he has been driving for a few years.

**Speaker 2:** Having a license for years doesn't mean he has much driving experience.
**Speaker 1:** Is he driving a private car or something else?

**Speaker 2:** It's not convenient to say, but he has been driving for a few years.

**Speaker 1:** But having a license doesn't necessarily mean having practical driving experience. I've had my license for a long time, but my actual driving experience came much later.

**Speaker 2:** He shouldn't be a complete novice; he might just be nervous.

**Speaker 1:** When he turned left, he kept a good distance from the pedestrians on this road.

**Speaker 2:** He was driving close to the centerline. Look, we're approaching the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like he didn't cross the line. It looks like he didn't.

**Speaker 2:** He turned left and then reached the waypoint. He was quite cautious, sometimes coming to a complete stop and waiting for another car to finish its maneuver before proceeding.

**Speaker 1:** Can I point something out? There was a moment that seemed dangerous. From the camera, it looked very close.

**Speaker 2:** It was fine. He was almost stopped, and the other car wouldn't have hit him because he was aware of his surroundings.

**Speaker 1:** That left turn seemed normal.

**Speaker 1:** Are you done?

**Speaker 2:** In 100 meters, we'll reach the waypoint. We're almost there.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any particularly bumpy sections of the road?

**Speaker 2:** No, the roads in Beijing are generally good. Everything seemed normal. He was just being cautious. Continue straight through the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver change speed at all?

**Speaker 2:** It didn't seem like it. He was driving quite steadily.

**Speaker 1:** The ride was pretty smooth.

**Speaker 2:** The road conditions were good, and the route wasn't complicated. How does it look from here?

**Speaker 1:** We have another waypoint ahead.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right at the end of the road in 100 meters.

**Speaker 1:** This road is also quite smooth.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right onto the main road, then move to the leftmost lane.

**Speaker 1:** How did the right turn feel?

**Speaker 2:** It was normal. In 400 meters, make a U-turn at the traffic light. You should check if he used the turn signal because I don't remember if he did. This might not be directly related to your timing, but it's important.

**Speaker 1:** The single traffic light signal here doesn't seem to matter much. In 200 meters, turn right. What we are concerned about is the experience when he didn't use the turn signal. This is what I'm focusing on.

**Speaker 2:** It felt like riding in a Beijing taxi. It's not necessarily dangerous if he's skilled.

**Speaker 1:** It felt dangerous, right?

**Speaker 2:** Not really dangerous. If he's experienced, it should be fine.
**Speaker 1:** The road conditions are like this, not sure what the issue is.

**Speaker 2:** It feels dangerous, doesn't it?

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel it's dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** Well, it's not necessarily dangerous. If the driver is skilled, they can mitigate or compensate for the sense of danger. But...

**Speaker 1:** For our driver...

**Speaker 2:** I feel like the driver isn't very skilled. They might think it's just a side road, but then they don't use the turn signals, and if their skills aren't good, it becomes quite dangerous. If you think about a taxi driver, they are very familiar with their routes and can drive confidently. 

**Speaker 1:** Making a U-turn here...

**Speaker 2:** It's normal because the area is quite large, around 200 meters, and it's a designated U-turn spot.

**Speaker 1:** The braking material here...

**Speaker 2:** This position is normal.

**Speaker 2:** About to make a right turn, then...

**Speaker 1:** Should they be close to this car?

**Speaker 2:** It's a bit tight, I haven't noticed.

**Speaker 1:** But they are driving very slowly, so...

**Speaker 2:** It's fine because the speed isn't fast. These cars won't suddenly stop. Right turn, then immediately keep left.

**Speaker 2:** Keep left along the main road, then turn left in 80 meters. About to turn right in 60 meters. Turn left into the inner lane, then turn right. You can pull to the back; they have some issues with reversing. The safety officer in the back should have told them to park in the middle of the parking space. It seems they parked between two spaces, but other than that, there are no major issues.

**Speaker 1:** Didn't reverse properly, right?

**Speaker 2:** You can see they parked between two spaces. They should have reversed straight back, checking the rearview mirror.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like our parking space.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, clearly between two spaces.

**Speaker 1:** We've finished watching the video. I have a few more questions. Besides the scenarios we discussed, did the driver do anything else that you found dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** No, I think we've covered everything.

**Speaker 1:** What behaviors from a driver make you feel uneasy when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** When the driver is not skilled, like today.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Driving too fast.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, I think that's the main issue.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:** By having good skills. If you can handle every situation well, you can manage complex scenarios effectively.

**Speaker 1:** So, good skills...
**Speaker 1:** Your driving skills are good, but there were some misjudgments. Can you handle complex situations well?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for example, when encountering complicated road conditions, I can manage them effectively.

**Speaker 1:** Besides what we've already discussed, are there any other actions by drivers that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** No, I've already mentioned everything that bothers me.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what situations make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** It's really about the lack of proficiency. I find it very difficult when a driver is not skilled.

**Speaker 1:** Can you give specific examples of such actions?

**Speaker 2:** For instance, abrupt braking, lack of safety awareness, not checking mirrors before turning, or making sudden lane changes. In Beijing, it might be a bit better, but on highways, it can be quite dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** What kind of driving makes you feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Following the correct traffic rules and being proficient in driving.

**Speaker 1:** So, adhering to traffic rules. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Being skilled at driving. Even if you don't follow the rules strictly, like some Beijing taxi drivers, if you're skilled, it makes passengers feel safe.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:** There are two types: one who follows traffic rules and has average driving skills, and another who has excellent driving skills and also follows the rules.

**Speaker 1:** So, either following traffic rules or being proficient in driving is enough?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but if you don't follow the rules and are not skilled, that's very scary.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and new drivers?

**Speaker 2:** It's about handling different road conditions. Experienced drivers have encountered various situations and know how to deal with them.

**Speaker 1:** Do you consider yourself an experienced or a new driver?

**Speaker 2:** I wouldn't say I'm very experienced, just an average driver.

**Speaker 1:** Just an ordinary driver?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, an ordinary driver.

**Speaker 1:** Have you learned about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, from Baidu. I'm familiar with it, but I think it's not fully developed in China yet. It's more advanced abroad.

**Speaker 1:** In what ways do you think autonomous cars can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes people say artificial intelligence is more like artificial stupidity. So, I think it might never fully match human intuition and decision-making, like Elon Musk suggests.
**Speaker 1:** Do you think self-driving cars will ever be able to drive like humans?

**Speaker 2:** Well, sometimes people say that artificial intelligence is more like artificial stupidity. So, I think maybe, um, when it reaches the level that someone like Elon Musk defines, where autonomous driving truly meets his standards, then it might be possible. For example, handling and responding to various situations effectively, not just acting as an assistive tool. Right now, it's more about assisted driving rather than full autonomous driving. It can only serve as a driving aid. To reach the level of human judgment or that of an experienced driver, I think it still requires a lot of data and training. You see, training models involves a lot of data.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or was it the vehicle in autonomous mode?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not sure what you mean exactly. If you're asking whether it was a human driving or the car in autonomous mode, I think it was a human driving with some assistance. I'm not sure if there was any autonomous driving involved.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think it was a human driving?

**Speaker 2:** Why do I think it was a human driving? Well, because I observed the driver's behavior. There are different levels of autonomous driving, and I couldn't tell if there was any assistance making the driver nervous. From what I saw, the driver seemed quite tense, and the car responded accordingly. It’s unlikely that an autonomous system would learn and react that quickly. The synchronization between the driver's reactions and the car's responses seemed too precise for it to be fully autonomous.

**Speaker 1:** So, the reactions of the driver and the vehicle were in sync?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if the reactions of the driver and the vehicle were not synchronized, like if the driver was nervous but the car kept driving smoothly, then I would think it was autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:** Let's assume that the recent trip was in autonomous mode and the driver was just pretending to drive as a safety officer. How would that compare to your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 2:** If that were the case, then the autonomous driving system still has a lot of room for improvement. It felt like an inexperienced driver was behind the wheel.

**Speaker 1:** So, it felt unskilled, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt like a novice driver was driving.

**Speaker 1:** And the driving was quite jerky?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, it was quite jerky.

**Speaker 1:** So, it still didn't feel like autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not saying it did or didn't feel like autonomous driving. I'm just saying that either the driver was very good at acting, mimicking the car's unusual responses with their own behavior and expressions, or if it was truly autonomous driving, then the system is not yet ready for commercial use.
**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think that if the driver is driving himself, he wouldn't use the turn signal? Can you infer that from his driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if he is driving himself, he might not use the turn signal. Or, if he is a safety officer trying to confuse the situation, he might pretend that his skills are not high and also not use the turn signal. In that case, it might actually be the autonomous driving system that is using the turn signal. Autonomous driving must comply with traffic regulations. So, logically, the first rule of autonomous driving training is to follow traffic laws, right? If the driver is pretending to be a safety officer and not using the turn signal, the autonomous system would definitely use it. So, you asked me if it was autonomous driving. I didn't observe the turn signal issue. If I had observed it, I might have been able to judge correctly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you are a pedestrian crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the drivers of oncoming vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
I look to see if they are slowing down. If they are slowing down, it means they are letting you pass. If they are not slowing down, then...

**Speaker 1:**
In such situations, how do you usually cross the road?

**Speaker 2:**
In China, I usually stop and wait. No one would risk their life by crossing immediately.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in China, you wait until there are no cars before crossing, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, otherwise, in foreign countries, when I was abroad, people would stand by the roadside with their shopping bags and wait for the cars to pass. The cars would stop, and if you didn't cross, the drivers would signal you to go quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
Which country was that?

**Speaker 2:**
In the UK. Yes, that's how it is. That's all for today's questions. Thank you for participating in our experiment.
